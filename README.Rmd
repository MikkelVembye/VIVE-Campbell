# VIVECampbell: Functions for Campbell reviews in VIVE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The package provides functions used in Campbell reviews and meta-analyses conducted by [VIVE - The Danish Center for Social Science Research](https://www.vive.dk/en/). See also the VIVE Campbell [homepage](https://www.vive.dk/da/centre-og-netvaerk/campbell/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of VIVECampbell like so:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MikkelVembye/VIVECampbell")
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Load necessary packages
library(VIVECampbell)
library(dplyr)
```

## Example - Degrees of freedom calculation for cluster-designed studies

Calcualting degrees of freedom for studies with clustering in one treatment group only (Hedges & Citkowicz, 2015)

```{r}
## Degrees of freedom calculation for cluster bias correction when there is clustering in one treatment group only

h_eq7_hedges2015 <- 
  df_h_1armcluster(N_total = 100, ICC = 0.1, N_grp = 60, avg_grp_size = 5)

h_eq7_hedges2015
```

## Example - Data included in package

Data from the 'Targeted school-based interventions for improving reading and mathematics for students with or at risk of academic difficulties in Grades K-6: A systematic review' (Dietrichson et al., 2021)

```{r}

# Data from a Campbell Systematic Review conducted by Dietrichson et al. (2021)
glimpse(Dietrichson2021_data[1:20])

# Find documentation behind the data set by removing the below #
#?Dietrichson2021_data

```
