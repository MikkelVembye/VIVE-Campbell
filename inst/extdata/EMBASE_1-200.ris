N2  - Background and Objectives: Although racial disparities in pediatric pain have been described, family-centered research is lacking. This mixed-methods study aimed to understand race-specific factors impacting acute pain experiences in Non-Hispanic White (NHW) and Black (NHB) children. Method(s): NHW and NHB children (aged 8-17) (n=19 each) with a recent acute pain experience, and their caregivers were recruited. The following domains were assessed in children (deprivation, ethnic identity, pain, psychosocial, pain coping, resilience) and caregivers (education, income, Racial and Ethnic Microaggressions Scale (REMS), Adverse Childhood Events (ACEs), Adult Response to Child's Symptoms). Questionnaire measures were compared between groups using simple statistical tests. Fifteen dyads participated in focus groups. Thematic codes underlying pain experiences were identified. Result(s): NHB children had similar pain/psychosocial characteristics but differed in ethnic identity (2.7 (0.5) vs. 2.2 (0.5); P=.002), deprivation index (0.4 (IQR 0.3-0.5) vs. 0.3 (IQR 0.2, 0.3), P=.007) and pain coping efficacy (8.6 (0.4) vs. 9.8 (0.5), P=.045) from NHW children. NHB caregivers scored higher on REMS sub-scales, ACEs (0 (0,1) vs 0 (0,0); P=.02) and Protection (1.9 (0.6) vs. 1.6 (0.5); P=.03) behaviors in response to child pain. NHB and NHW participants endorsed satisfaction with pain experiences, opioid avoidance, and stoicism. Unlike NHW participants, NHB reported barriers related to trust, discrimination, and access. Conclusion(s): Racial differences in acute pain experiences suggest healthcare providers need to reinforce trust and consider underlying cultural and pain coping differences when treating pain in NHB children. Findings emphasize that family-centered and systems-based approaches are important for equity in pediatric pain.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Kelp cultivation is a rapidly expanding economic sector, as kelp are valued for a wide range of commercial products and for restoration of kelp forest ecosystems. Microbes associated with kelp and other macroalgae play a critical role in processes such as nutrient exchange, chemical signaling, and defense against pathogens. Thus, manipulating the microbiome to enhance macroalgal growth and resilience is a promising, but largely untested, tool in sustainable kelp cultivation. The core microbiome hypothesis suggests that bacteria that are consistently found on a host (the core microbes) are likely to have a disproportionate impact on host biology, making them an attractive target for microbiome manipulation. Here, we surveyed wild Saccharina latissima and their surrounding environment to identify core bacterial taxa, compared to cultivated kelp, and experimentally tested the effect of cultured bacterial isolates on kelp development. We find that core bacteria are nearly absent in cultivated juvenile sporophytes in nurseries but eventually colonized after outplanting kelp to ocean farm sites. We find that bacterial inoculants can have both positive and negative effects on kelp development. In line with predictions from the core microbiome hypothesis, we find a positive correlation between the frequency of the bacterial genus in the wild and the bacterial effect on the number of sporophytes in kelp co-culture experiments.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic placed enormous strain on healthcare workers (HCW) and systems. With currently over 766 million cases, a high risk of workplace-acquired infection and a constantly evolving disease trajectory, COVID-19 placed an incredible burden on frontline HCWs. Studies from previous pandemics highlight significant psychological distress in these workers, yet mental health remained a secondary consideration in many hospitals pandemic response. This review explores the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline HCWs during the early stages of the pandemic and describes responses implemented by health services to reduce this impact. Additionally, it aims to provide a framework for future evidence-based programs that support the wellbeing of frontline HCWs throughout the ongoing pandemic and into the future, helping to prepare for Disease X. Method(s): A systematic review was completed using MEDLINE, CINHAL and Cochrane databases with bibliographic and grey literature searches. Result(s): 17 publications were included. Symptoms of psychological distress were reported in up to 70% of frontline HCWs, with as many as 50% suffering depression, 62% reporting anxiety and 45% of those requiring quarantine experiencing insomnia. Mindfulness training, safe rest areas, mental health practitioners and pandemic rostering are responses that have been implemented across health services during the pandemic, but their efficacy in reducing psychological burden has not been fully assessed. Conclusion(s): The impact of COVID-19 has been enormous; however, its final toll remains unknown. High rates of psychological distress amongst frontline HCWs means the impact will extend far beyond the virus itself. Health services must implement evidence-based resilience strategies to ensure the safety of their frontline staff now and into the future.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Self-isolation is a public health measure used to prevent the spread of infection, and which can have an impact on the psychological wellbeing of those going through it. It is likely that self-isolation will be used to contain future outbreaks of infectious disease. We synthesised evidence on the impact of home self-isolation on psychological wellbeing of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022378140). We searched Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, and grey literature (01 January 2020 to 13 December 2022). Our definition of wellbeing included adverse mental health outcomes and adaptive wellbeing. Studies that investigated isolation in managed facilities, children, and healthcare workers were excluded. We followed PRISMA and synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) guidelines. We extracted data on the impact of self-isolation on wellbeing, and factors associated with and interventions targeting wellbeing during self-isolation. We included 36 studies (most were cross sectional, two were longitudinal cohort studies, three assessed interventions, and five were qualitative). The mode quality rating was 'high-risk'. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were most investigated. Evidence for an impact of self-isolation on wellbeing was often inconsistent in quantitative studies, although qualitative studies consistently reported a negative impact on wellbeing. However, people with pre-existing mental and physical health needs consistently reported increased symptoms of mental ill health during self-isolation. Studies reported modifiable stressors that have been reported in previous infectious disease contexts, such as inadequate support, poor coping strategies, inadequate and conflicting information, and the importance of regular contact from trusted healthcare professionals. However, interventions targeting psychological wellbeing were rare and evaluative studies of these had high or very high risk of bias. When implementing self-isolation directives, public health officials should prioritise support for more vulnerable individuals who have pre-existing mental or physical health needs, lack support, or who are facing significant life stressors. Clinicians can play a key role in identifying and supporting those most at risk. Focus should be directed toward interventions that address loneliness, worries, and misinformation, whilst monitoring and identifying individuals in need of additional support.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Background: The Health Brain Initiative (HBI), established by University of Miami's Comprehensive Center for Brain Health (CCBH), follows racially/ethnically diverse older adults without dementia living in South Florida. With dementia prevention and brain health promotion as an overarching goal, HBI will advance scientific knowledge by developing novel assessments and non-invasive biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), examining additive effects of sociodemographic, lifestyle, neurological and biobehavioral measures, and employing innovative, methodologically advanced modeling methods to characterize ADRD risk and resilience factors and transition of brain aging. Method(s): HBI is a longitudinal, observational cohort study that will follow 500 deeply-phenotyped participants annually to collect, analyze, and store clinical, cognitive, behavioral, functional, genetic, and neuroimaging data and biospecimens. Participants are >=50 years old; have no, subjective, or mild cognitive impairment; have a study partner; and are eligible to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recruitment is community-based including advertisements, word-of-mouth, community events, and physician referrals. At baseline, following informed consent, participants complete detailed web-based surveys (e.g., demographics, health history, risk and resilience factors), followed by two half-day visits which include neurological exams, cognitive and functional assessments, an overnight sleep study, and biospecimen collection. Structural and functional MRI is completed by all participants and a subset also consent to amyloid PET imaging. Annual follow-up visits repeat the same data and biospecimen collection as baseline, except that MRIs are conducted every other year after baseline. Ethics and expected impact: HBI has been approved by the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Participants provide informed consent at baseline and are re-consented as needed with protocol changes. Data collected by HBI will lead to breakthroughs in developing new diagnostics and therapeutics, create comprehensive diagnostic evaluations, and provide the evidence base for precision medicine approaches to dementia prevention with individualized treatment plans.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Introduction South Africa has one of the highest rates of internal migration on the continent, largely comprised of men seeking labor in urban centers. South African men who move within the country (internal migrants) are at higher risk than non-migrant men of acquiring HIV yet are less likely to test or use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, little is known about the mechanisms that link internal migration and challenges engaging in HIV services. Methods We recruited 30 internal migrant men (born outside Gauteng Province) for in-depth qualitative interviews at sites in Johannesburg (Gauteng) where migrants may gather (i.e., factories, homeless shelters). Interviewers used open-ended questions, based in the Theory of Triadic Influence, to explore experiences and challenges with HIV testing and/or PrEP. A mixed deductive inductive content analytic approach was used to review data and explain why participants may or may not use these services. Results Migrant men come to Johannesburg to find work, but their struggle to survive without reliable income causes daily stress. Stress and time constraints limit their availability to seek health services, and many men lack knowledge about the opportunity for PrEP should they test negative. In addition, migrants must also adjust to life in Johannesburg, where they may be unfamiliar with where to access HIV services and lack social support to help them do so. Migrants may also continue to travel intermittently for work or social purposes, which can make it hard to take a daily pill like PrEP. Yet Johannesburg also presents opportunities for HIV services for migrant men, especially those who perceive greater availability and anonymity of HIV information and services in the city as compared to their rural homes of origin. Conclusions Bringing HIV services to migrant men at community sites may ease the burden of accessing these services. Including PrEP counseling and services alongside HIV testing may further encourage men to test, particularly if integrated into counseling for livelihood and coping strategies, as well as support for navigating health services in Johannesburg.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Background/Rationale or Objectives/Purpose Many lung cancer patients experience Fear or Anxiety about the Recurrence of Lung Cancer (FARLC). Extant research on cancer suggests that support for FARLC is the most significant and unmet need. We aimed to assess which types of support are needed and desired and to what extent lung cancer patients' needs are being met. Methodology or Methods Together with the Canadian Lung Cancer Advocacy-Breathe Hope, a purposedesigned questionnaire was distributed online via e-mail, newsletters and social media in Canada. All questions were multiple-choice. Impact on Practice or Results Out of 121 respondents, 119 had experienced FARLC and were included in the present study. While over 82% of respondents reported having access to mental healthcare services, 67% of patients reported that they were never referred to mental health services by their oncology team. The most important coping strategies were (1) talking to someone about FARLC (71%), (2) distracting oneself with enjoyable activities (61%), and (3) gaining practical tips on dealing with FARLC (50%). The most influential systems of support identified were patient support groups online and in person (65%), psychologists/therapists within the hospital/cancer care centre (47%), and friends, family and co-workers (42%). Discussion or Conclusions Most lung cancer patients reporting FARLC indicated a need for more support, but the majority are not receiving information or referrals for mental health support from their oncology care teams. Many patients rely on patient support groups, friends and family for support. Serious gaps in the mental health support available to lung cancer patients need to be addressed.

N2  - Background: Since nursing job is perceived as personally and professionally demanding, internal resources such as resilience and coping skills are essential to improve nurses' health and wellbeing and therefore work productivity and quality of patient care. Objective(s): To assess the effect of social support on nurses' resilience. Moreover, we investigated the impact of demographic characteristics of nurses on their resilience. Method(s): We conducted an on-line cross-sectional study in Greece. Data were collected during October 2022. We used the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support to measure social support, and the Brief Resilience Scale to measure resilience. We measured the following demographic characteristics of nurses: gender, age, self-perceived health status, COVID-19 diagnosis, MSc/PhD diploma, and clinical experience. Result(s): Study population included 963 nurses with a mean age of 37.9 years. Nurses experienced moderate levels of resilience and high levels of social support. Multivariable linear regression analysis identified that increased significant others support and increased friends support were associated with increased resilience. Moreover, we found a positive relationship between age and resilience. Also, nurses with good/very good health had higher levels of resilience compared to nurses with very poor/poor/moderate health. Finally, resilience was higher among nurses with MSc/PhD diploma. Conclusion(s): We found a positive relationship between social support and resilience among nurses. Understanding of factors that influence nurses' resilience can add invaluable knowledge to develop and establish tailored programs. Peer support is essential to improve nurses' resilience and promote patient healthcare.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Background: A significant percentage of COVID-19 patients experience post-COVID-19 symptoms and signs. Post-COVID-19 syndrome affects physical and mental health of patients in several ways. Aim(s): To investigate the impact of post-COVID-19 syndrome and related dysautonomia on patients' life and work productivity. Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional study in Greece using an online questionnaire. Study population included 108 workers over 18 years old that have been diagnosed with post-COVID-19 syndrome. Patients were recruited from the Long COVID Greece patients' society. We measured demographic and clinical characteristics of patients, resilience, and social support. Result(s): Among patients, 68.5% stated that post-COVID-19 syndrome affected their daily life to a great extent, 25% to a moderate level, and 6.5% to a small extent. Moreover, 56.5% stated that post-COVID-19 syndrome affected their work productivity to a great extent, 27.8% to a moderate level, and 15.7% to a small extent. Multivariable analysis identified that females and patients with post-COVID-19 dysautonomia had more problems in their daily life. Moreover, increased duration of COVID-19 symptoms was associated with increased daily problems. Increased resilience was related with fewer problems in daily life. Also, we found that patients with post-COVID-19 dysautonomia had less work productivity. Moreover, increased duration of COVID-19 symptoms was associated with more problems in work. Resilience was related with increased work productivity. Conclusion(s): Post-COVID-19 syndrome and related dysautonomia affect significantly patients' daily and work life. Also, resilience is an important preventive factor improving patients' life. Policy makers should develop and implement educational programs to improve patients' life. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the post-COVID-19 syndrome and its consequences in order to understand post-COVID-19 patients and their problems.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Background: Veterans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and related identities (LGBTQ+) have faced discrimination that puts them at increased risk for depression, anxiety, and suicide. Upstream interventions like the PRIDE in All Who Served program can improve internalized prejudice, suicide attempt likelihood, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of anxiety by addressing minority stress, facilitating social connection, and promoting engagement with the healthcare system. Yet, little is known about who benefits most from these types of services. Method(s): Sixty-six US military veterans (Mean age = 47.06, SD = 13.74) provided outcome surveys before and after a 10-week health promotion group for LGBTQ+ individuals at one of 10 Veterans Health Administration (VA) Medical Centers. Coping self-efficacy and key demographic factors were examined as moderators of treatment outcomes. Result(s): Coping self-efficacy moderated effects across treatment outcomes with those lower in coping self-efficacy beliefs reporting the greatest benefit of the intervention. Reduction in anxiety symptoms was moderated only by problem-solving coping self-efficacy, while suicide attempt likelihood was moderated only by social support. Reduction of internalized prejudice and depression symptoms were moderated by both problem-solving and social support coping self-efficacy, while thought-stopping (a frequent target of traditional cognitive therapies) only moderated internalized prejudice, but not clinical symptom indicators. Most demographic factors (e.g., age, race, gender) did not impact treatment outcomes; however, sexual orientation was significant such that those who identified as bisexual, queer, or something else (e.g., pansexual) had greater reductions in internalized prejudice than their single gender-attracted peers. Conclusion(s): Individual differences like coping self-efficacy and sexual orientation are rarely considered in clinical care settings when shaping policy or implementing tailored programs. Understanding implications for who is most likely to improve could inform program refinement and implementation of affirming interventions for minoritized people.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Background: Heart failure (HF) continues to be a global health problem with its ramifications more pronounced in underdeveloped countries. Family members play a pivotal part in patient management which may influence the patient's overall quality of life. Prolonged delay in attendance to health care facilities among patients indicates ineffective support from family caregivers. In the Tanzanian context, there is limited information about the experiences of family caregivers in caring for patients with HF. This study explored family caregivers' experiences in caring for HF patients. Method(s): A qualitative descriptive study design was conducted at Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. A purposive sampling technique was used to select the potential participants. A sample size of 10 family caregivers of patients with HF was included in the study. Thematic analysis was used to derive the main theme and sub-themes. Result(s): Three major themes were identified: demands for supportive care, new caring role and lifestyle, and professional support in caring for patients with HF. Caregivers needed social and financial support to facilitate the caring process. Learning to provide the required care at the right time was the new role acquired by caregivers while failing to participate in social events and caregiving in an unfavourable environment were reported as challenges in caregiving. However, compliance with instruction and effective interaction among the nurses and caregivers were considered to be positive professional support. Conclusion(s): Caregivers need social and financial support to provide effective care to their patients. Caregiving is a learning process that needs continuous educational support to adapt to the new caring roles and challenges. Nurses should conduct regular assessments to explore caregivers' needs, challenges, and concerns and provide timely counselling that can facilitate coping.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Background Preoperative counselling refers to an educational intervention before surgery which aims at improving patient's knowledge, health and outcome [1]. Studies have consistently shown that one of the major causes for patient dissatisfaction is lack of information about what is being done to them. According to Cohen F, Lazarus RS, it has been proven that a significant mode of coping with a stressful event is by obtaining information about it. It allows people to modify, avoid or minimize the impact of the situation, thereby reduces the degree to which it is appraised as stressful [2]. There have been many studies undertaken that has looked into the relation between preoperative counselling and various individual aspects surgical experience like anxiety, length of hospital stays, mobilization, satisfaction etc However, we were unable to find literature that shows relation between pre-operative counselling about routine elements of perioperative care and patient's overall surgical experience through their first surgical journey. Hence, our study was a novel attempt to find whether educating patients on those aspects of peri-operative care inherent to all surgical procedures but often unaddressed have a role in improving patient's overall surgical experience. Objective To study the effect of pre-operative educational counselling about routine elements of peri-operative care on patient's experience through their first surgical journey in a tertiary care centre. Methodology IRB and IEC clearance was sought. Trial was registered in CTRI (Clinical Trial Registry -India) and registration number obtained. Patients charted for their first-time surgical procedures, who satisfy our inclusion criteria were enrolled into the Randomised Control Trial. In the absence of a suitable questionnaire in the regional language, one was developed, validated by an expert committee of 9 members (including 6 doctors,2 nurses, and a counsellor) and statistically validated by a qualified bio-statistician (using Cronbach's alpha). A pilot study was run on twenty patients to calculate sample size(n=62). Patients who receive pre-operative educational counselling about routine elements of peri-operative care were grouped as interventional group (group A) and patients who receive standard hospital care were grouped as control group (group B). After 48 hours of surgery, surgical experience questionnaire was administered by blinded assessor. Patient details obtained from medical records. (n=62 with 32 in group A and 30 in group B) Overall surgical experience score was administered to all participants by blinded assessor using patient's responses on the five-point Likert scale Statistical analysis of data entered in excel spreadsheet was be done using R software. Results It has been observed that there is significant difference between the overall surgical experience score of the interventional (SD =3.2) and control group (SD=6.44). The counselled group is more confident and are more satisfied with the overall surgical experience. Also, the counselled group has higher scores while comparing the individual domain scores that is -preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative surgical experience scores. Conclusion We observed that educating patients on those aspects of peri-operative care inherent to all surgical procedures but often unaddressed have a significant role in improving patient's overall surgical experience. pre-operative counselling elevated patient's confidence and improved their overall surgical experience. Hence, counselling pertaining to peri-operative care could be promoted among patients undergoing surgery which would improve their overall surgical experience.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 control measure stringency including testing has been among the highest globally in China. Psychosocial impact on pandemic workers in Shanghai, and their pandemic-related attitudes were investigated. Method(s): Participants in this cross-sectional study were healthcare providers (HCP) and other support workers. A Mandarin self-report survey was administered via Wenjuanxing between April-June 2022 during the omicron-wave lockdown. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Maslach Burnout Inventory were administered, as well as pandemic-specific questions. Result(s):887 workers participated, of which 691 (77.9%) were HCPs. They were working a mean of 6.25+/-1.24 days/week for 9.77+/-4.28 hours/day. Most participants were burnt-out, with 143(16.1%) moderately and 98(11.0%) seriously. Total PSS was 26.85+/-9.92/56, with 353(39.8%) participants having elevated stress. Workers perceived their families primarily as fully supportive (n=610, 68.8%), or also extremely concerned (n=203, 22.9%). Most wanted counselling and stress relief, but half(n=430) reported no time for it; indeed, 2/3rds wanted a few days off to rest (n=601).Many workers perceived benefits: that they fostered more cohesive relationships (n=581, 65.5%), they will be more resilient (n=693, 78.1%), and were honored to serve (n=747, 84.2%).Negative impacts were greater in HCPs, those with economic insecurity, and that did not perceive benefit (all p<.05).In adjusted analyses, those perceiving benefits showed significantly less burnout (OR=0.573, 95% CI=0.411 - 0.799), among other correlates. Conclusion(s): Pandemic work, including among non-HCP, is stressful, but some can derive benefits.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the fractures of healthcare systems around the world, particularly in relation to the healthcare workforce. Frontline staff have been exposed to unprecedented strain and delivering care during the pandemic has impacted their safety, mental health and wellbeing. Rapid Research methods and big qualitative data offered a unique opportunity to gain insight into perceptions and experiences during this time. Objective The aim of this paper was to explore the experiences of Health Care Workers (HCWs) delivering care in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic to understand their wellbeing needs, experiences and strategies used to maintain wellbeing at individual and organizational levels. Methods We analysed 94 telephone interviews with HCWs and 2000 tweets about HCWs mental health during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic applying Collaborative and Digital Analysis of Big Qualitative Data in Time Sensitive Contexts (LISTEN). Results Results fell under six themes: redeployment, clinical work, and sense of duty; wellbeing support and HCW's coping strategies; negative mental health effects; organisational support; social network and support; and public and government support. Redeployment generated anxiety mainly due to limited prior training and risk assessments, and the barriers of adapting to a new working environment while wearing PPE. HCWs struggled to access wellbeing support due to time constraints. In terms of ill mental health, mentions of feelings of trauma, PTSD and anxiety were prominent. HCWs' mental health was particularly affected by the copious amount of bad news on media and at home and the fear of infecting their loved ones. Conclusions These findings demonstrate a need for open conversations, where staff wellbeing needs and the strategies they adopted can be shared and encouraged, rather than implementing solely top-down psychological interventions. At the macro level, findings also highlighted the impact on HCW's wellbeing of public and government support, as well as the need for ensuring protection through PPE, testing, and/or vaccines for frontline workers.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Natural fire regimes are currently changing worldwide. These alterations may affect not only plant and animal species but also their interactions. Recently, a few studies have shown the effects of different disturbances on pollination through changes on plant fragrances mediating this interaction, yet no studies have focused on the effects of fires. Here, we assessed whether wildfires can modify plant scents and, in turn, pollinator attraction in a widespread palm in the western Mediterranean Basin. We studied the fire-adapted palm Chamaerops humilis and its nursery (dominant in unburnt sites) and non-nursery (dominant in recently burnt sites) beetle pollinators. In nursery pollination systems, where pollinators develop inside their host plant, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants to attract pollinators can be crucial because of the tight interdependence among the interacting species. However, these systems can also involve non-nursery co-pollinators whose importance is context dependent, and potentially relevant for plant success after disturbance. We first compare scent composition between plants growing in burned and unburned sites after recent wildfires; then we conducted olfactory bioassays with the two beetle pollinators. Fires changed the palm's scent composition; however, the two pollinators responded similarly to scent from burnt and unburnt areas which may ensure plant reproduction even after recent fire events. We show, for the first time, that wildfires can alter plant fragrances mediating mutualistic interactions, and that flexible pollinator responses to variable odourscapes can enhance resilience in plant performance.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Background: Sequelae of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were investigated by both patient-initiated and academic initiatives. Patient's subjective illness perceptions might differ from physician's clinical assessment results. Herein, we explored factors influencing patient's perception during COVID-19 recovery. Method(s): Participants of the prospective observation CovILD study with persistent somatic symptoms or cardiopulmonary findings at the clinical follow-up one year after COVID-19 were analyzed (n = 74). Explanatory variables included baseline demographic and comorbidity data, COVID-19 course and one-year follow-up data of persistent somatic symptoms, physical performance, lung function testing (LFT), chest computed tomography (CT) and trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE). Factors affecting illness perception (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, BIPQ) were identified by penalized multi-parameter regression and unsupervised clustering. Result(s): In modeling, 47% of overall illness perception variance at one year after COVID-19 was attributed to fatigue intensity, reduced physical performance, hair loss and baseline respiratory comorbidity. Overall illness perception was independent of LFT results, pulmonary lesions in CT or heart abnormality in TTE. As identified by clustering, persistent somatic symptom count, fatigue, diminished physical performance, dyspnea, hair loss and sleep problems at the one-year follow-up and severe acute COVID-19 were associated with the BIPQ domains of concern, emotional representation, complaints, disease timeline and consequences. Conclusion(s): Persistent somatic symptoms rather than clinical assessment results, revealing lung and heart abnormalities, impact on severity and quality of illness perception at one year after COVID-19 and may foster unhelpful coping mechanisms. Besides COVID-19 severity, individual illness perception should be taken into account when allocating rehabilitation and psychological therapy resources.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Background: High levels of stress and anxiety in nurses negatively affect their physical and mental health and lead to poor job performance, limited job satisfaction, high levels of burnout and increased intention to leave the profession. By promoting resilience in nurses it is possible to reduce negative consequences for those working in highly stressful workplaces. Objective(s): To summarize the evidence about the relationship between social support and resilience among nurses. Method(s): We performed a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched Pubmed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cinahl from inception to August 28, 2022 using the following search strategy in all fields: ((resilience) AND ("social support")) AND (nurses). Result(s): Applying the inclusion criteria, we found six studies that investigated the relationship between social support and resilience among nurses. Two studies were conducted in China, two studies in Turkey, one study in Haiti, and one study in Taiwan. All studies were cross-sectionals and used convenience samples. All studies found a positive relationship between social support and resilience among nurses. In studies that used multivariable analysis, coefficient beta ranged from 0.13 to 0.69, while in studies that used correlation analysis, correlation coefficient ranged from 0.18 to 0.37. Conclusion(s): We found that social support improves resilience among nurses. It is necessary to make systematic efforts to support nurses especially in the workplace. This need is even greater for inexperienced nurses, as it is more difficult for them to cope effectively with the difficulties of the profession. A harmonious working environment is essential to reduce the psychological pressure of nurses and improve job performance.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Introduction Despite the disproportional impact of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on historically marginalized racial and ethnic communities, the individual and sociocultural factors underlying these health disparities remain elusive. We report the design and methods for a study aimed at identifying the epigenetic mechanisms by which risk and resiliency social factors affect gene function and thereby influence SLE in a health disparity population. Methods and analysis The Social Factors, Epigenomics, and Lupus in African American Women (SELA) study is a cross-sectional, case-control study involving the Medical University of South Carolina, Emory University, and Wake Forest School of Medicine. A total of 600 self-reported African American females will be invited to participate. All participants will respond to questionnaires that capture detailed sociodemographic and medical history, validated measures of racial discrimination, vicarious racism stress, social support, healthcare utilization and lost productivity, as well as disease activity and damage for cases. Physician-reported disease activity will also be incorporated Participants will choose if they wish to receive their genetic ancestry estimates and be involved in research. Blood samples are required to provide serum, plasma, PBMCs counts, DNA and RNA. The primary goals of SELA are to identify variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with self-reported exposure to racial discrimination and exposure to social support, to evaluate whether social DNAm sites affect gene expression, to identify the synergistic effects of social factors on DNAm changes on SLE, and to develop a social factors-DNAm predictive model for disease outcomes. This study was approved by and will be conducted in cooperation with the Sea Island Families Project Citizen Advisory Committee. Discussion and dissemination SELA will respond to the pressing need to identify the regulatory mechanisms through which social exposures influence SLE in a health disparity population, clarify the interplay and underlying mechanism by which various positive and negative social determinants of health influence epigenomic variation, and how the resulting biological changes may contribute to the lupus health disparity. Results will be published and shared with patients and the community. These findings may inform the development of psychosocial interventions that prevent or mitigate risk exposures, and services or interventions that promote positive exposures. Development of these novel treatments and preventative interventions, as informed by the results of this study, is paramount to the closure of the health disparities gap.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Background: Disaster risk reduction involves several sectors, legal, social, structural, economic, technological, educational, environmental health, with improved preparedness will be able to reduce the impact of disasters. Capacity that continues to be added with knowledge about rapid disaster response to disasters can make resilience dealing with disasters and preventing the emergence of disaster risks. Purpose(s): Conduct a literature review on articles that examine the importance of disaster education in the initial handling of emergencies in the hospital area Design: Literature review Method: Using databases with electronic search on ProQuest, SAGE, and Science Direct published in 2017-2021 Results:100 articles were used in the review. These articles discuss the importance of disaster education in the initial handling of emergencies in the hospital area. The 15 articles reviewed are original research. Conclusion(s): Local communities are well placed to play a central role in hazard identification, development of preparedness plans, detection and response to emergencies, and implementation of recovery efforts. Community leaders and local health workers (e.g. family doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, community health workers) can build public trust, disseminate information, and identify people at risk.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

T1  - Factors influencing COVID-19 Infection in older individuals: History of Alcohol Use Disorder, Major Depressive illness, genetic variation and current use of alcohol

N2  - Introduction: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a major public health problem. Vulnerable populations include older individuals with presumed weakening of the immune response. Identification of factors influencing COVID-19 infection could provide an additional means for protecting such individuals. Method(s): Members of a family study previously interviewed as middle aged individuals were re-contacted and asked to participate in extended phone interview (2-3 hours) covering past and current mental health issues, physical health diagnoses, use of alcohol and drugs, and exposure to anyone with COVID-19. The average follow-up period was 32 years. Detailed medication use was collected to confirm medical diagnoses and to reveal possible protective effects of particular drug classes currently prescribed for the participant by their physician. Serology was available for red cell antigens (ABO, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, Rhesus) and HLA subtypes. Analyses were conducted to contrast COVID-19 + and COVID-19 - individuals for physical and mental health diagnoses, use of alcohol and drugs, and red cell and HLA serology. Additionally, analyses were conducted to contrast these groups with a group reporting known exposure but absence of COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosis by a health professional. Result(s): Interviews were completed between September 2020 and November 2021. A total of 42 of the 90 individuals interviewed had been vaccinated at the time of interview. At the time of interview, 11.1% reported having developed COVID-19. Using quantity per occasion (QPO) and quantity by frequency (QXF) totals in the past month by type of alcohol consumed, we found a significant association between QPO for liquor (p=0.017) and marginal effects for QXF for liquor consumption (p=0.06). Exposed individuals who were COVID-19 negative tended to drink more liquor than those who were positive, an average of about one drink per day. Beer and wine consumption were not statistically significant. A diagnosis of alcohol use disorder at baseline evaluation was not a significant predictor of being COVID positive or negative. Self-reported current depression or depression in the past only was not a predictor of COVID-19 status based on a single question "Are you depressed currently or only in the past?". In contrast, completion of a clinical interview designed to elicit depressed mood and concurrent symptoms for determination of the lifetime presence or absence of a depressive episode did reveal a significant effect. Comparison of responses at baseline to follow-up showed those most resilient to developing COVID-19 were those without evidence of a depressive episode by lifetime history at both points in time. Physical health issues were analyzed for those that were frequently occurring in our sample such as hypertension but not found to be significant. BMI was analyzed and found to be statistically non-significant. Analysis of HLA variation across the whole sample did not reveal a significant association but among males two variants, A1 and B8, did show significant variation associated with COVID-19+ and COVID-19- status. Analyses of the red cell antigens revealed one significant red cell effect; Kidd genotypic variation was associated with COVID-19 status. Interpretation(s): We tentatively conclude that use of specific types of alcohol, namely liquor, is associated with reduced frequency of COVID-19. However, the amount is low, averaging about 1 drink per day. Enlarged samples are needed to confirm these results. The finding that past history of alcohol use disorder does not increase likelihood of developing COVID-19 is important. It should be noted that the 34 individuals diagnosed with AUD at baseline had survived an average of 32 years in order to participate in the current interview suggesting they may be especially resilient to adverse health conditions. The finding that a single question designed to elicit the presence or absence of depressed mood either currently or in the past was not a risk factor for COVID-19 in contrast to report of a clinically significant past history of a depressive episode based on more extensive examination using DSM criteria is important. Results for the KIDD blood group are novel and warrant further investigation.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Objective: Dementia grief can be described as a caregiver's anticipatory grief experience due to losses occurring before the care recipient's physical death. Among other things, these losses can include loss of memory, intimacy, communication, relationship resolution, and family identity. Psychosocial interventions have been developed to address and reduce these pre-loss grief reactions. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence on existing dementia grief interventions for caregivers of persons with dementia (PwD). Method(s): Electronic databases Web of Science (SSCI), PsycArticles, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX Literature with PSYNDEX Tests and MEDLINE were searched from September 2016 to September 2021. The systematic review was carried out following PRISMA guidelines and it was registered to the PROSPERO database (CRD42021268998). All adult family or friend carers of older persons with dementia were included. All types and severity stages of dementia were included except studies about young onset dementia and dementia grief. Also, family carers could not be bereaved. Result(s): The 12 included studies contained multifaceted interventions with heterogenous formats. Eight studies had a quantitative, two a qualitative and two a mixed method design. Sample size ranged from two to 273 participants. Interventions included elements of psychoeducation, cognitive and emotional therapeutic strategies based on CBT, acceptance- based and mindfulness-based strategies. The interventions showed statistically significant small to moderate effects on dementia grief. In addition to the effects on dementia grief, the interventions also had a positive impact on mental health-related variables such as burden, depression, empowerment, and resilience. Conclusion(s): There has been an increase in dementia grief interventions suggesting that dementia grief has been acknowledged as a valid and important construct to describe the dementia caregiver experience. It remains unclear whether health care providers know about and implement elements of the grief interventions in every day clinical encounters with dementia caregivers. Thus, future research should determine the practicing health care providers' knowledge about dementia grief and its available interventions. Furthermore, it should be examined whether the intervention effects are transferable to caregivers of patients with other terminal illnesses or degenerative disorders, or whether they must be modified.

N2  - Objective: In the last decades, the issue of caring for a sick parent at young age has received increased attention due to recent changes in society. The term carer (also known as caregiver) refers to anyone who carries out, on a regular and unpaid basis, significant caring tasks for a friend or family member who cannot cope alone because of an illness or other condition. Existing evidence suggests that young carers tend to have more mental health problems and more difficulties in behavioral, psychosocial, and academic adjustment than their peers without an ill parent. Since caring can be viewed as a natural extension of family relationships, young people often do not receive support from social policy, health and social services. Therefore, the aim of this review was to systematically ascertain the literature on psychological interventions for young carers (aged 11-30 years), aimed to promote their mental health and well-being, thus mitigating the psychosocial impact of caring on their development. Method(s): A systematic literature search was performed in CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus; in addition, reference lists from reviewed papers were used to identify additional relevant studies. A rigorous screening process was followed, and a checklist for qualitative and observational studies was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. Narrative synthesis of the selected articles was carried out. Result(s): Only 9 studies were included. Interventions had a different nature and mixed evidence on their efficacy emerged. Moreover, several methodological concerns limited study replicability. Conclusion(s): Given the clinical relevance of this topic, it is important that these interventions and the new ones will undergo rigorous evaluation. Effective interventions for young carers may also lead to considerable savings in healthcare and societal costs.

N2  - Background The medical profession, with its remarkable physical and emotional demands, predisposes physicians to compassion fatigue (CF) and burnout (BO). Though these conditions have been studied individually, little attention has been paid to how pediatric emergency physicians experience these conditions in the context of an Asian emergency setting especially during a global pandemic. Objectives In our study, we aim to understand the experiences of individual physicians and describe the potential triggers or protective factors of CS, BO and compassion satisfaction (CS) amongst physicians in an Asian pediatric emergency department during a pandemic. Methods A qualitative, individual interview methodology was employed. From March to April 2020, we enrolled 20 physicians involved in frontline care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the pediatric emergency department to participate. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, audiotaped and transcribed in verbatim, with identifiers removed. Themes were identified and data analysed using qualitative data analysis and iterative data analysis. Results We recruited 20 physicians. Three themes emerged from data analysis. Firstly, we showed how workplace conditions are protective, including work morale, leadership and management and social support received. Secondly, workload affected participants emotionally and in terms of its heavier quantity and longer hours. Finally, intrinsic factors that were protective in developing CF or BO include having professional autonomy, experience, work-life balance and having emotional resilience to develop self-care. Cultural influences affect emotional regulation and can lead to negative coping with negative peer pressure. In general, participants quantified their levels of satisfaction at work as average to above-average. However, they highlighted experiencing greater stress during COVID-19 with the underlying fear of contagion and infection. Conclusions Being a pediatric emergency physician puts one at greater risk of experiencing CF and BO because of work and non-work stressors especially during a global pandemic, influenced by sociocultural factors. A positive and supportive work environment should be created while providing culturallyadapted strategies to improve individual physician resilience to maintain their well-being.

N2  - Background Providers of children with developmental disabilities (DD) had to rapidly innovate to translate face to face care to a virtual platform in order to continue to support the needs of their patients during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. Objectives We aimed to explore the extent of psychological ill-effects, if any, and explore resilience in providers of children with DD. Methods This was a voluntary cross-sectional study involving an anonymous questionnaire, administered via a secure online platform, between 13 May and 1 July 2020, coinciding with the Circuit Breaker (similar to a lockdown) period in Singapore. Participants included healthcare providers serving children with DD in various capacities at public and private healthcare settings in the country. Common diagnoses of DD included autism spectrum disorder and global developmental delay. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 25-item were administered. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Results Ninety-five responses were received. Mean age of respondents was 37.4 years (SD 9.45), with 96.8% of them being female. A quarter (24.5%) were medical professionals (doctor, nurse, psychologists), a third (33.0%) were therapists (physiotherapists, speech therapists and occupational therapists), a third were school-based providers (teachers in mainstream or special-education schools, learning support educators), and the rest (8.5%) were working in administrative aspects of dealing with children with DD (case manager, social workers, administrative staff). A quarter (25.5%) worked in a hospital, 20.2% worked in a school setting, 37.2% at a therapy centre (e.g early intervention centres), while 17.0% worked in social community agencies. On the DASS (table 1), more than half (56.8%) of the respondents had a positive screen for stress, of which half of these (53.7%) had levels which were in the 'extremely severe' range. Almost half (42.1%) of providers had anxiety, of which 45.0% of these were 'extremely severe'. Depression rate was lower, with a positive screen present in 13.7% in this group of providers, and half of these were in the 'mild' range. Chi-square analysis showed that providers in schoolbased institutions were more likely than providers in nonschool- based institutions to have a positive screen for depression on the DASS-21 (36.8% vs 8.0%, p=0.004). Mean resilience scores on the CD-RISC 25 was 62.7 (range 36.0 to 88.0), lower compared to the published normative data for this scale. Conclusions Providers of children with DD face significant psychological ill-effects during this pandemic, as well as lower resilience compared to the general population. Targeted institutional support for these providers and interventions to improve their resilience are both crucial to enhance the mental well-being of these providers. This will in turn facilitate continued provision of care for children with DD despite the pandemic. (Table Presented).

T1  - DESIGNING A WORKABLE REFLECTIVE PRACTICE GROUP FOR THE ACUTE PAEDIATRIC TEAM

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Background 'Acute take' is rarely synonymous with 'relaxing day at work' for a health care professional. Although many of us thoroughly enjoy the challenges, we know that the digestion of the shifts may be hard and the processing, of often complex interactions, difficult. There are high standards that we place on ourselves, and finding this energy in itself can be tough. The terms 'wellbeing', 'resilience' and 'self-reflection' involve personal processes, often evolving over time. Whilst we build our strength and learning of these nuanced skills there is increasing evidence that a safe space and a supportive network of colleagues is paramount to a healthy work relationship. We built facilitated time into the work schedule for our team to reflect, allowing space to help one process cases and build on their own 'emotional training'. Objectives To establish a workable format which facilitated reflection on difficult emotional clinical events and interactions for our heterogenous peer group. Furthermore, to determine whether colleagues would choose to keep attending the sessions and whether participation would help emotional learning from one another. Methods We established a fortnightly one-hour Reflective Practice Group for all trainees and consultants within the neonatal and paediatric department. The group was facilitated by a trained psychoanalytic psychotherapist, with experience of leading Balint groups. Participants were encouraged to bring a case from the past few weeks and the participants were invited to reflect openly with each other, we used the structure of Balint Groups to guide us. Questionnaires comprising quantitative and qualitative information were collected following 10 sessions. The qualitative results were collected by one of the authors and findings reviewed for common themes. Results From 18 responses, 94% of responders said they would reattend and welcome further sessions. The barriers and enablers to the group are themed and summarised in table 1. 77.8% of responders felt they, in just a few sessions, had learnt from others reflections. Conclusions Recurring phrases included 'awkward, forced and unstructured' but also 'relevant, beneficial and closure'. Our team clearly requires flexibility on entering the group late, eating cake at a table, allowing seniors to share comfortably and for there to be a planned case. Modification of sessions can be helpful in making the groups meaningful, relevant for training needs and less alienating. A workable solution therefore needs to be an evolving quality assured one. A frenetic work schedule may prevent the emotional digestion of the workload and cases. A scheduled session for the team to digest the week can be extremely beneficial. In our opinion the key is to adapt the sessions to fit the group of individuals for whom it is trying to support. We now plan to measure whether the 'Monthly Digest' group has a beneficial effect on colleague reflection and well-being. (Table Presented).

N2  - Aims. The BMA's survey results (Caring for the Mental Health of the Medical Workforce, 2019) and HEE's NHS Staff and Learners' Mental Wellbeing Commission report (2019) highlighted declining staff wellbeing. The COVID-19 pandemic has sharpened focus on this and the effects of moral injury on healthcare professionals. Shielding, social distancing and redeployment led to many medical trainees being increasingly isolated at a time of heightened anxiety and adversity. Psychiatry trainees tend to have good access to reflective groups, but this is not customary in other training programmes. Method. Intervention Trainees4trainees was set up by trainees across specialties as a HEE-TV well-being project, led by the Deanery Trainee Improvement Fellow. Peer support groups are run on Zoom, facilitated by 2 trainees with special training in peer support. Psychiatry trainees have been involved in designing and facilitating groups and training facilitators from other specialties; facilitators have regular supervision from a consultant psychiatrist in medical psychotherapy. Trainees are supported to discuss challenging experiences and think about their emotional responses in a supportive and validating group. Result. Feedback We are in the process of formal data collection to assess the impact of the intervention. Informal feedback suggests the groups are a powerful support to individuals who otherwise have no avenue to think about the psychological impact of their experiences. The groups have supported trainees to feel less isolated and bolstered their resilience. Conclusion. Future plans We have faced challenges in the practicalities of establishing and maintaining groups. We are working with Training Programme Directors to move towards running the groups in protected time within working hours and advocate that reflective groups, such as our peer support groups, are a key part of future medical and surgical Training Programmes.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Background: More than 37,000 Danes were diagnosed with cancer last year and approximately 285,000 Danes are cancer survivors. The Danish Cancer Society offers professional information and counseling free of charge to all people affected by cancer. Last year, the telephone cancer information service Kraeftlinjen received more than 14,000 inquiries, the majority from patients, relatives and bereaved. User surveys are usually conducted immediately after the users' contact with the cancer information service, and thus, only capture the users' experiences with and short-term effects of the contact. To investigate the long-term effects, a follow-up survey was recently conducted as a supplement to the latest user survey of the cancer information service. Aim(s): The follow-up survey aims to investigate the long-term effects of using the cancer information service focusing on the users' perception of their situation after the contact including their perceived changes in behavior and their ability to communicate with others about the disease. Method(s): In March-April 2017, users of the cancer information service were encouraged to answer a questionnaire about their experiences with this service. The questionnaire was sent by either mail or e-mail. In total, 461 users participated in this survey. Two hundred and twenty six users (49%) agreed to receive a short follow-up questionnaire three months after their initial contact with the telephone cancer information service. One hundred and thirty six users (60%) participated in this follow-up survey. Result(s): The majority of the respondents reported that their conversation with the telephone cancer information service led to changes in their perception of their situation (77%) and made them better at coping with their situation (79%). As an example, some participants described that the conversation made them more calm and able to accept their situation, which again led them to feel less stressed and anxious. In addition, many users stated that they had become more able to communicate with others about their disease (66%) and that the contact had let to changes in their behavior (63%). Some participants described to have contacted the hospital or their doctor after their contact with the cancer information service and some described that they had become better at asking health personnel questions about the disease. Others had become more aware of their rights and of looking out for themselves or others. Most participants (77%) stated that they had not felt a need to contact the cancer information service again. Conclusion(s): The majority of the participants experienced that the cancer information service had made them better capable of coping withtheir situation.

N2  - Background: The concept of quality of life (QOL) refers to the ability to enjoy normal life activities; it is a complex combination of satisfactory functioning in essential four core domains physical, psychological/emotional, social and quality of life is an important aspect of care in the clinical setting; nurses can improve patient's quality of life by ensuring they are competent in daily practice, and by giving patients a high quality holistic care based on safe, effective intervention and providing required information. Aim(s): To evaluate the quality of life of cancer patients in relation to different treatment modalities and evaluate the impact of the information given on the quality of life. Method(s): A convenient sample of adult cancer patients recruited from a university hospital, Cairo, Egypt. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaire or patient structured interview. Tools used: EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) and QLQ-INFO25. Data analysis includes descriptive statistics and exploration of relationships between key variables; physical, emotional, social well-being, type of treatment, information given and quality of life. Result(s): Preliminary results revealed significant correlation between fatigue, emotional disturbance and quality of life. Lack of information is also correlated with low quality of life. Patients expressed their needs for more clarification about treatment, coping with disease and future consideration. Conclusion(s): Quality of life should be assessed frequently by nurses throughout treatment phases to identify patients at risk. Nurses also should emphasize on proper patients teaching and counseling to promote physical psychosocial balance and improve quality of life.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Trainee physicians are exposed to adverse patient outcomes and events. They can experience guilt, anxiety, incompetence, or anger in association with these events, leading to high rates of burnout (defined as emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), decreased personal accomplishment (PA)), and decreased resilience. Prior studies have identified the need for strategies to reduce burnout and build resilience in pediatric residents during critical care rotations. Debriefing sessions can be therapeutic, allowing members to discuss challenging cases. This study examines the effects of regular debrief on burnout and resilience in pediatric residents during their pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) rotation in a tertiary PICU. METHOD(S): Second and third-year pediatric residents completing a 4-week PICU rotation were asked to complete the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and Conor Davidson Resilience Scale (CDR) on the first and last day of rotation. In alternating 4-week blocks, residents received 2 debrief sessions to discuss sentinel events of their rotation amongst fellow residents (intervention arm) or were exposed to standard practice (controls). Participant survey responses were matched from beginning to end of rotation. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed. RESULT(S): In the interim analysis, 40 residents were enrolled; 20 received intervention and 20 as controls (mean+/-SD of age was 31.1+/-3.3 yrs). Change in MBI scores (EE, DP, and PA) from first to last day of the rotation were significantly lower in the intervention arm compared to controls (p=0.0003, p< 0.0001, p=0.0086, respectively); The median(IQR) score changes in the intervention arm were:-8.5(-16.0 to 6.0), -2.0(-5.5 to 4.0), -6.0(-12.0 to 0.0) for EE, DP and PA, compared to 9.5(4.0 to 20.5), 11.0(7.5 to 16.0), 3.5(-2.5 to 9.0) for EE, DP and PA, among controls, respectively. The distribution of change in CDR was significantly different between the arms; resilience increased in the intervention arm and decreased in the controls (12(3.5 to 27.5) and -13(-27 to -2) respectively, p< 0.0001). CONCLUSION(S): There is evidence that debrief sessions focused on resident well-being reduce burnout and improve resilience skills. Implementing trainee debriefing sessions focused on well-being should be considered.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Medical student wellbeing and resiliency is essential to the future of medicine. Students are exposed to difficult end of life situations as well as impactful emotionally charged events. The Institute of Medicine and the ACGME acknowledge the importance of promoting the psychological, emotional, and physical well-being of trainees to create competent, caring, and resilient physicians, but there is a lack of targeted medical student education in combating physician burnout. This project established debriefs for 4th year medical students during a required ICU course. We hypothesized that we would benefit students by sharing experiences, discussing resiliency skills, and providing an open forum for discussion of other impactful situations that arose. METHOD(S): One hour debriefs were facilitated by critical care faculty, palliative care, resiliency clinicians, and ethicists during the last week of the ICU rotation. At completion, students completed an anonymous Redcap survey. This included demographic data, brief question sets (1-5 Likert scales) targeting burnout and wellbeing factors, and free text questions on their ICU experiences, value of the session, and takeaways. Descriptive statistics were used to assess survey items. RESULT(S): 119 medical students participated. Surveys showed that factors associated with positive aspects of wellbeing were negatively correlated with feeling less interested in talking to patients (p<=0.05). Factors associated with burnout were positively correlated with feeling less empathetic toward patients, less connected with patients, less connected with colleagues, and less sensitive to others' emotions (p<=0.05). Qualitative analysis showed that ICU resilience promoters included social support, downtime, and share experiences with faculty and colleagues. Resilience inhibitors included long hours and large workloads, challenging clinical cases, and workplace management issues. CONCLUSION(S): Medical students found the debrief process beneficial. It promoted the discussion of coping mechanisms, resiliency building, and shared experiences. We recommend incorporating scheduled debriefings into medical school training, especially around critical care rotations to promote wellbeing.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Institutions are expanding to satellite sites to improve access to inpatient and ICU care. The varying clinical scope of multiple sites requires a customized approach to identify and promote resiliency while retaining highly reliable patient-centered care. We hypothesized that a standardized sharing of real-time data on activity, acuity, and outcomes thru all ICU sites using the resilience framework of respond, monitor, learn, and anticipate, could minimize unnecessary variation, and recognize necessary adaptations. METHOD(S): A multidisciplinary team (physicians, advance practice providers, nursing, administrative and quality) identified and reviewed regularly, 6 activity, 8 acuity variables and 16 patient-centered outcomes using real-time data acquired from five sources. We qualitatively analyzed how we responded, what we monitored, how learning guided responses, and how adaptations directed future needs. Unnecessary variation in monitored metrics received directed interventions and necessary adaptations informed anticipatory plans. Data pre- and post-intervention were compared using student's t-test, *p< 0.05. RESULT(S): Sustainable data review engaged all five ICUs across three sites for over 14 months. Example data driven response and impact of actions include: 1) Two community ICUs with similar scope had differing length of stay (LOS) for bronchiolitis patients with one ICU having internal variation in respiratory wean practices. Standardized weaning resulted in decreases in median times of noninvasive ventilation by 41% [27 to 16 hours*], NPO status by 34% [39 to 26 hours*] and LOS by 15% [41 to 35 hours] with no change in intubations or readmissions. 2) Weekly device stewardship rounds reduced Foley days [Mean/month: 64 to 39*] within 6 months. Adaptations included managing: 1) increased unplanned extubation rates with overflow of respiratory patients to cardiac ICU and 2) winter rise in rapid response calls. Anticipatory responses planned for future patient overflow and seasonal demands are just-in-time training and modified resource allocation. CONCLUSION(S): A resilience framework allows optimization of variation, both necessary and unnecessary, within the complex socio-technical environments of multisite ICUs.

N2  - Background: Individuals recently diagnosed with Inflammatory bowel Disease (IBD) often have unmet informational and psychological needs, leading to distress and anxiety. This lack of support negatively affects their quality of life, mental health, social functioning, and physical outcomes. Additionally, the absence of counselling and peer support isolates many people and places an emotional burden on them. Delayed diagnosis or misdiagnoses due to symptoms being dismissed by health professionals exacerbate the problem. Acknowledging these unmet needs and adverse outcomes, this study aims to shed light on patients' experiences to inform improvements in clinical practice, support services, and workplace policies, particularly during the immediate diagnosis phase. Aim(s): The aim of this study is to explore the experience of people newly diagnosed with IBD and their need for support. Method(s): The study employed interpretive phenomenology semi-structured interviews following a topic guide and analysed the data using Braun & Clark's (2023) thematic analysis method and Nvivo software. Crohn's and Colitis UK (CCUK) charity acted as the gatekeeper for access to participants. Participants were purposively selected on specific criteria: IBD diagnosis <=1 year, aged 16 or older, English language proficiency and diversity of demographic and clinical variables. Result(s): Of 49 volunteers who responded to the research advertisement, 15 were selected based on eligibility criteria. Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1. Four themes emerged (Fig 1), with 12 subthemes. Participants expressed extreme dissatisfaction, either due to misdiagnosis or diagnostic delays, indicating the need for timely streamlined diagnosis. Additionally, IBD diagnosis itself triggered distress and anxiety. Participants reported the need for continuous psychological counselling and peer support. Due to symptoms like blood loss and diarrhoea, IBD profoundly affects physical health, emotional wellbeing, social interactions, and work-life balance, hence challenging patients' sense of normalcy. However, patients demonstrated resilience via lifestyle adjustments, social support networks, and coping strategies. Conclusion(s): This qualitative study sheds light on the profound impact of an IBD diagnosis. It reveals emotional struggles and the need for streamlined diagnosis and psychological support. Lifestyle disruptions affect physical and mental health, but participants adapt through support and coping. These insights have practical implications for improving care, mental health services, workplace adjustments, social support, and coping resources for the newly diagnosed IBD population. Future research should expand to larger, diverse patient samples.

N2  - Background and Aims: This ongoing PhD project seeks to develop a person-centred, evidence-based, theoretically informed prototype intervention to support psychosocial and emotional well-being and resilience in people with IBD's family members (FMs). PhD project focuses on the intervention development and feasibility testing. The development phase has already been undertaken using a co-design approach informed by Design Thinking. A systematic review and qualitative research have been conducted and published, and co-design workshops have been held with people with IBD (n=4), FMs (n=9), and IBD nurses (n=2), revealing a preference for online-based intervention. Therefore, the aim of this study is to translate the paper-based intervention prototype into electronic format. The online prototype will be a) tested for acceptability and b) effect signal. The feasibility of the study design will be evaluated. Method(s): A sequential mixed methods approach, based on the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) Evaluation Framework. The intervention feasibility study will test the acceptability of content and delivery of the intervention and ascertain active feedback. The feasibility of the study design will be evaluated the recruitment, data collection, retention, and analysis strategies. A two-arm feasibility RCT with nested qualitative evaluation will be used to evaluate the newly developed intervention among 60 FMs. Participants will be recruited via Crohn's & Colitis UK and Bowel Research UK charities. The 60 participants will be randomly allocated into intervention and control groups using 2:1 randomisation. The qualitative component will use purposive sampling from the intervention arm to elicit feedback on the content and format with up to 20 participants. Anticipated Impact: Results from this intervention development and feasibility study will help revise the intervention, incorporate changes to the study protocol (if necessary), and develop a large-scale RCT for efficacy trailing of a complex intervention to benefit service users.

N2  - Background and Aims: Medical students and residents experience higher rates of burnout, anxiety, depression, and suicide[1]. The Wellness Wave (WW) initiative was developed to promote a culture of wellness in medicine, decrease isolation, and to empower medical students. Goals included opportunities for students to lead important discussions, connect with mentors, and create their own wellness toolkits. Methods / Intervention: Internal Medicine leaders from different career stages and settings were invited to participate in studentled interviews. Content included career advice and best wellness practices such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and laughter therapy. Interviews released via a website (acpwellness. org) and were promoted through social media. Sponsorship by American College of Physicians Southern California Region III Chapter and Society of General Internal Medicine. Results / Impact: 38 mentor interviews led by 16 medical students. Collaborations between 22 institutions and two professional organizations fostered numerous connections around wellness. 1600 views to date. Conclusion(s): Increasing levels of isolation, anxiety, depression, burnout, and suicide in medical students and residents are alarming[1]. Mitigating stressors, mentorship, and accessing wellness resources are essential to reversing these trends. The WW bridged this gap by creating a diverse community and fostering open and candid discussions about career pathways, wellness practices, coping strategies, and building inclusive environments. Students garnered tools for their own wellness and incorporated their voices into potential solutions. More research and support to decrease unique stressors faced by physicians-intraining is vital prior to their entry into the workforce.

N2  - Aims. Emotional intelligence is crucial for medical professionals. Medical interns are expected to have a high degree of emotional intelligence to face their professional career challenges. Emotional intelligence, often measured as an emotional quotient (EQ), is the capacity to recognize and regulate emotion in oneself. It enables one to monitor own feelings and emotions and others; and guide decisions and actions, and is crucial to ensure a successful work-related outcome or good performance. A higher EQ enhances physician and patient well-being, increases patient safety and augments healthcare teamwork. However, studies about EQ among medical interns are lacking. Therefore, this study intended to determine the level of EQ among medical interns in Malaysia and its associated factors. Methods. This nationwide cross-sectional study recruited new medical interns reporting to 17 randomly selected Malaysian hospitals accredited for medical intern training from January to April 2020. They were invited to answer an online questionnaire incorporating USMEQ-i to measure EQ, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 items (CD-RISC-10) for resilience, Brief-Cope to assess coping styles, PHPQ to assess internship preparedness, DUREL for religiosity, and questions related to sociodemographic and undergraduate training. Results. A total of 524 from 619 medical interns responded. Mean (SD) EQ score was 3.08(0.58). Significant factors positively associated with EQ include resilience score (adjusted b = 0.65, 95% CI 0.58, 0.72, p <0.001), preparedness for internship (adjusted b = 0.11, 95% CI 0.09, 0.13, p < 0.001), approach-style coping (adjusted b = 0.17, 95% CI 0.11, 0.24, p <0.001), and religiosity (adjusted b = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01, 0.17, p <0.001). In contrast, avoidant-style coping (adjusted b=-0.19, 95% CI -0.28, 0.11, p <0.001) is negatively associated with EQ. Adjusted R2 of 67.6% substantiated the goodness of fit of the regression model. Conclusion. This study showed that there are a few modifiable factors that significantly influence EQ among medical interns; namely resilience, coping style, preparedness for internship, and religiosity. There is a positive association between EQ and approach coping style, and a negative relationship with avoidant coping. Approach coping encapsulates constructive responses to stress such as positive reframing, acceptance, seeking helpful information, and reaching for emotional support, while avoidant coping includes self-distraction, denial, venting, substance abuse, behavioural disengagement, and self-blame. These significant factors in this study such as coping and resilience can be learned and taught as a skill. These findings will aid medical schools to design programmes and improve the medical education to increase EQ among medical students who will become better medical interns and doctors in the future.

T1  - The Impact of Stigma on Forensic Psychiatric Patients - a Case Report
T3  - Royal College of Psychiatrists International Congress, RCPsych 2022. Edinburgh United Kingdom.

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Aims. The Royal College of Psychiatrists' Fair Deal (RCPsych 2008) highlighted the far-reaching impact of stigma and discrimination on the lives of people with mental illness. The pervading nature of stigma has been acknowledged in recent national and international mental health policies (WHO). The World Health Organisation reiterates people affected by mental illness should not suffer social exclusion and marginalisation due to stigma. Methods. A sixty-year-old gentleman presented to the Emergency Department following self-inflicted stabbing to the neck resulting in pharyngeal tear and surgical repair. Previous psychiatric history included inpatient admission on Section 2 following a major depressive episode. On this admission, inpatient psychiatric review elicited three months of psychotropic medication nonadherence due to difficulties the patient had encountered in acquiring repeat medications from his GP. He had relapsed into alcohol misuse as a coping mechanism culminating in a suicide attempt at home with a knife. Upon recommencing of sertraline and risperidone during admission, he was assessed as euthymic with low risk to self. The patient had been previously abstinent from alcohol and described religion as a protective factor. Prior to discharge, the patient's GP stated he must present to the surgery in person with a form of identification. This is despite CQC guidance stipulating practices should not refuse patients registration if proof of identity cannot be produced. Results. This case illustrates the socioeconomic factors increasing likelihood of suicide including forensic history, low financial status, unstable housing and lack of social support. Substance dependence is a risk factor that can be reduced by supporting patients in accessing specialist misuse input from inpatient and community teams. The patient reported fear of stigmatisation and criminalisation which led to the avoidance of seeking treatment, deterioration in mental health and severe clinical consequences. It is imperative marginalised patients with mental illness can access quality health care and this starts with GP registration. Conclusion. Forensic mental health patients experience multiple stigmas impacting on well-being including social, institutional and media stigmatisation and high levels of internalised stigma. The Time to Change campaign focused on changing attitudes and behaviour however evaluation illustrated difficulties in tackling this issue. Healthcare professionals should be mindful to avoid stigmatising language and actions to ensure fairness in care. There is a need for the medical profession to continue striving for a tangible shift in attitudes. Advocating for those with mental illness can enhance quality of life for vulnerable patient groups.

N2  - Aims. A mental health promotion programme called 'Healthy Me', was a collaboration between Action Mental Health (AMH) MensSana, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in the Southern Health and Social Care Trust and the Royal College of Psychiatry (RCPsych) in Northern Ireland in 2014. Adapting 'Healthy Me' for delivery in special schools was recommended in evaluation of this pilot programme. A co-produced pilot adapted 'healthy me' programme, for young people with ID was taken forward by Action Mental Health (AMH) MensSana and Intellectual Disability Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (ID CAMHS) in the Southern Health and Social Care Trust (SHSCT). To determine the feasibility of adaptation and delivery of the programme for the needs of the ID population. To inform changes to be made before wider roll-out. To promote children's social and emotional well-being and emotional literacy through the teaching of problem-solving, coping skills, conflict management and managing feelings. To evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention with children being able to retain learning, information and ideas. Methods. Evaluation * Pre programme quiz July 2021 (young people) * Post session 1-5 quizzes (young people) * Post programme quiz October 2021 (young people) * Simple visual blob tree (young people) Outcome Measures * Pre programme initial outcome measure (parent) The Mood, Interest and Pleasure Questionnaire-short form (MIPQ-S) July 2021 * Pre programme initial outcome measure (parent) non standardised, based on the strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) and the Child and Youth Resilience Measure-Revised Person Most Knowledgeable version (PMK-CYRM-R) July 2021 * Post programme repeated outcome measure (parent) MIPQ-S October 2021 * Post programme repeated outcome measure (parent) Based on SDQ & PMK-CYRM-R October 2021 Results. Six participants identified at outset and four attended and engaged consistently, young people aged between 14 and 17 years. Participants were supported 1:1 to fill in a simple evaluation forms after sessions rating their enjoyment and what they had learnt. Repeating the MIPQ-S with parents highlighted some improved scores indicating positive affect and elevated interest and pleasure. Conclusion. The programme will be offered to in the next stage of the pilot to Special Schools in NI. It is hoped to show that similar positive gains can be made in the school settings for children and young people with intellectual disability in terms of promoting positive mental health and social and emotional well-being.

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Aims. Chronic insomnia is a common mental disorder that severely impacts the quality of life of those affected, increases the risk of comorbid mental disorder and physical illness, and makes treatment of other mental disorders less effective. It is particularly common in patients under secondary care mental health services. Once chronic, insomnia rarely resolves spontaneously. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a highly effective treatment that is recommended by the UK's National Institute of Health and Care Excellence as the first-line treatment. Despite this, CBT-I is not universally available or accessible throughout the UK. Therefore, LW obtrained training at a sleep clinic and then initiated, ran and evaluated a new CBT-I service for existing community patients within her NHS trust. Methods. Patients received individual holistic assessments with a psychiatry trainee, a 5-session weekly virtual group intervention run by LW, and an individual 3-month follow-up. LW also trained other psychiatry trainees to run future groups, initially under supervision. Clinical rating scales were employed at initial assessment, following the final workshop and at follow-up. Results. Seven patients completed all sessions, with five completing a 3-month follow-up review. All had suffered with chronic insomnia for over 5 years. All had moderate-to-severe insomnia on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at assessment (mean 21.3), which had improved by the end of treatment (mean 14.3). All patients seen at follow-up either no longer had insomnia or had sub-threshold insomnia on the ISI (mean 7.2). From assessment to post-treatment to follow-up, mean scores on the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep Scale reduced from 6.6 to 3.7 to 2.5, and mean scores on the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure reduced from 2.18 to 2.01 to 1.27. Mean scores on the Work and Social Adjustment Scale reduced from 23.6 (severe impairment) at assessment to 7.0 (low impairment) at follow-up. Two patients stopped taking sleeping tablets during the treatment, and remained off them at follow-up. Conclusion. Group CBT-I can be a highly effective treatment for insomnia for patients under CMHT services. In this service run by a psychiatry trainee without formal sleep medicine or CBT qualifications, the efficacy of the intervention on insomnia symptoms, as well as on anxiety and depressive symptoms, was similar to the efficacies found in clinical trials and in specialist sleep clinics. CBT-I can be easily learnt by psychiatry trainees and likely other professionals with psychological expertise, which could increase the availability and accessibility of this effective treatment.

N2  - Background and Aims: This study measured burnout and resilience among Internal Medicine physician trainees in a tertiary government hospital in Manila, Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic. It explored their sources of stress and coping mechanisms, and determined the predictive factors for burnout. Method(s): An online cross-sectional survey among all Internal Medicine physician trainees was done to measure burnout and resilience using the Maslach Burnout Index Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel and the Connor-Davidson Resiliency questionnaires respectively. Sources of stress and coping mechanisms were identified through online focus group discussions and interviews until thematic saturation was satisfied. Multiple linear regression was done to explore the predictors for burnout. Result(s): Out of 146 respondents (74% response rate), four percent of physician trainees fit the burnout profile, 40% were engaged while the majority had intermediate profiles. The mean resilience score was 72.9 (SD 12.4). Resilience was a significant negative predictor for burnout (Beta Coefficient= -0.73, p<0.001). Its protective effect decreases in those with increased exposure to patient deaths (Beta Coefficient= 6.767, p<0.05). The trainees' major sources of stress included navigating the new normal and having competing demands for professional growth. Their main coping mechanisms included flexibility, maintaining social relationships, and self-care. Conclusion(s): Although the prevalence of burnout was low among Internal Medicine physician trainees, the majority exhibited atrisk burnout profiles a few months into the COVID-19 pandemic. Resilience was found to be high among the physician trainees and was a significant negative predictor for burnout.

N2  - Aims. To conduct a systematic review of reviews to investigate how military deployment of a parent affects his/her child, and the extent to which the child's own perspectives have been documented. Background. Lengthy but finite disruptions to parenting in any form may affect child development and mental and physical health. Military deployment means weeks or months of separation from one parent. 2016 figures for the U.S. military showed that 40.5% of military personnel have children, and of these 1.7 million children the largest percentage are aged between 0-5 years (37.8%). Method. Seven databases were searched: AMED, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE 1947, Joanna Briggs Institute EMP database, Ovid MEDLINE 1946 and PsycINFO 1806 from the inception of each electronic database until 31st March 2018. Inclusion criteria: Child and young adults aged 0-24 years English language papers only All papers being systematic reviews or meta-analyses A focus on documenting the effects on child outcomes Data extracted included the review methods and child outcomes reported, including educational attainment; physical symptoms; mental illnesses or disorders; changes to behaviours, and effects on peer and parental relationships. Result. The eight reviews identified included 32 common and relevant studies. Across the various studies, only about 20% of data came directly from children. Five papers extracted from the reviews identified parental deployment as having a negative effect on school attainment. Nine studies extracted from the review papers found a positive correlation between having a deployed parent and a greater chance of experiencing depressive symptoms and feelings of anxiety. Strong correlations of increased prevalence of both externalising & internalising behaviours were conclusively found in 7 of the reviews. Increased resilience was detailed in only one study featured in multiple reviews. Just one study featured across the reviews reported on physiological measures adolescents with deployed parents had higher blood pressures and significantly higher heart rates and stress scores than civilian children. Conclusion. More research obtaining the viewpoint of the child directly and observation of such children is required to properly understand the effects on children with a deployed parent, without the interference of parent or teacher reporting bias. Additionally, with only one study reporting on increased offspring resilience there has been limited exploration of potential positive correlates, so further research regarding these is important.

N2  - Aims. The aims of our study were to assess and to examine i. the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical residents working on the front and second line, ii. the association between coping strategies, resilience and optimism and different mental health outcomes like stress, anxiety, and depression among the medical residents' workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and iii. the coping strategies used on the same sample with consideration of different factors like seniority, frontliner, gender and coping style. Method. An electronic survey was sent to all medical residents in Qatar. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items. Professional quality of life was measured by the Professional Quality of Life measure. The coping mechanisms were assessed with the Brief-COPE, resilience by the Brief Resilience Scale, and optimism by the Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). Result. of the 640 medical residents contacted, 127 (20%) responded. A considerable proportion of residents reported symptoms of depression (42.5%), anxiety (41.7%) and stress (30.7%). Multivariate analysis of variance showed significant effects of seniority in residency, with junior residents having poorer outcomes. In addition, there was a statistically significant interaction effect with moderate effect sizes between gender and working on the front line, as well as gender, working on the front line and seniority, on mental health outcomes. The most commonly used coping strategies were acceptance, religion, and active coping. The least reported coping strategies were substance use and denial. Avoidant coping style scores were higher among junior residents (p = .032) and non-COVID-19 frontliners (p = .039). Optimism LOT-R score was higher in senior than in junior residents (p < .001). Another important finding is that optimism and resilience were associated with better mental health outcomes. In addition, we find that avoidant coping style is highly associated with depression. Conclusion. The COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative impact on junior residents' mental health. Preventive measures to reduce stress levels and easy access to professional mental health services are crucial. This study also raises awareness among residency programs on the psychological and coping responses and strategies of medical residents.

T1  - Strategic resilience in human performance in the context of science and education - perspective
A1  - Ziehr S.
A1  - Merkt P.H. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Introduction: Special situations that jeopardize the internal and external security for communities are increasing in their frequency and complexity. This creates complicated challenges for individuals, governments and humanity. National and international strategies are being developed that focus on the resilience and coping of all first responders during these extreme stress states. Aim(s): The aim of the article is to present the framework of strategic resilience, its multidimensional measurement and the possibilities for training robust resilience to increase operational effectiveness in special operational situations. Methodological approach: Research in the area of special operation situations often focuses on the human performance cluster. The Unit of Applied Research 18_RECESS (18_ Research and Education Center for Extraordinary Tactical Situations and Strategically Resilience) at the Department of Disaster Prevention and Crisis Management at Fresenius University of Applied Sciences in Idstein fits into this field. It pursues the adaptation of existing resilience models to special operation situations in line with the definition of strategic resilience. In addition, the focus is on the possibility of training strategic resilience to increase operational effectiveness. There are currently several research projects being conducted in the civilian and civilian-military sectors, as well as with ground and special operations forces. Major findings: Strategic Resilience with its 3 axes Psychological, Physiological and Cognitive Resilience covers the core domains of various existing models of resilience. This provides an adequate concept to describe different factors leading to personnel perseverance in special operation situations. There exists the possibility to train several domains of strategic resilience via problem-oriented intervention (POH).Copyright © 2024 Ziehr and Merkt.

N2  - Content Burnout occurs commonly in palliative care. Building resilience helps to mitigate the effects of burnout. Little is known about the importance of leaders, teams and organisations in preventing burnout and promoting resilience in palliative care. Objectives We studied palliative care clinicians with more than a decade's experience looking into their experiences on the role leaders, teams and organisations play in burnout and resilience. Patients and methods This is a thematic analysis focusing on how leaders, teams and organisations influence burnout and resilience. 18 palliative care clinicians-5 doctors, 10 nurses and 3 social workers-who worked in various palliative care settings (hospital, home hospice and inpatient hospice) were interviewed using semistructured questionnaires. The mean age of the interviewees was 52 years old, and the mean number of years practising palliative care was 15.7 years (ranging from 10 to 25 years). The interviews were recorded verbatim and were transcribed and analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Results The following themes featured prominently in our study. For leaders: being supportive, caring and compassionate, being a good communicator and showing protective leadership. With teams: being like-minded, caring for the team, sharing the burden and growing together. For organisations: having a strong commitment to palliative care, supporting staff welfare and development, open communication, adequate staffing and organisational activities promoting staff wellbeing were described as protective against burnout and promoting resilience. Conclusion Leaders, teams and organisations play an important role in helping palliative care teams to reduce burnout and promote resilience.Copyright © 2024 BMJ Publishing Group.

T1  - Stress, hardiness and eating disorder symptoms in military academy cadets
A1  - Bartone P.T.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Eating disorders are a persistent and debilitating problem, especially among college age men and women. This problem is exacerbated in occupations such as the military, where maintenance of strict standards regarding weight, fitness and appearance is important for job retention and promotion. Also, previous research confirms that stress is a contributing element to eating disorders. It is thus important to identify factors that may assist individuals to remain resilient and avoid stress-related health and eating difficulties. The present study utilizes historical data to examine the impact of stress on health and eating disorder symptoms in a representative sample of West Point military academy cadets, while testing the role of gender and hardiness as stress moderators in this relation. A survey containing measures of stress, hardiness and eating disorders symptoms was completed by 387 cadets in the fall and spring of 2000-2001. Moderation effects were tested with advanced conditional process analysis procedures developed recently by Hayes (2022). Results show that hardiness was a significant moderator, with cadets low in hardiness showing increased eating disorder symptoms and more general health symptoms. While gender was not a significant moderator with respect to eating disorder symptoms, it was significant for general health symptoms; female cadets showed more stress-related health symptoms than their male counterparts. These results suggest that eating disorder symptoms in military academy cadets and college students more generally may be reduced through programs aimed at developing hardiness attitudes and stress coping approaches.Copyright © 2024 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - This paper provides and overview of the community support services that may be available for people with dementia and their family carers. The authors introduce dementia, including the impact of the diagnosis on both the person with dementia and the wider family. Using a case study approach, the authors describe the support available, spanning health and social care and third sector organisations. They discuss how this support can enable people with dementia and their carers to maintain wellbeing and cope with the impact of dementia. This article will be of interest to community nurses, and health and social care professionals more generally, who may encounter families affected by dementia in community settings. Having a good knowledge of the support available and how to access it will allow community nurses to capitalise on the health promotion opportunities presented to them, when they come into contact with families affected by dementia in the course of their day-to-day practice.

N2  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a heterogeneous condition that affects many civilians and military service members. Lack of engagement, high dropout rate, and variable response to psychotherapy necessitates more compelling and accessible treatment options that are based on sound neuroscientific evidence-informed decision-making. Art therapy incorporates elements proven to be effective in psychotherapy, such as exposure, making it a potentially valuable treatment option. This conceptual paper aims to inform the neurophysiological rationale for the use of art therapy as a therapeutic approach for individuals with PTSD. A narrative synthesis was conducted using literature review of empirical research on the neurophysiological effects of art therapy, with supporting literature on neuroaesthetics and psychotherapies to identify art therapy factors most pertinent for PTSD. Findings were synthesized through a proposed framework based on the triple network model considering the network-based dysfunctions due to PTSD. Art therapy's active components, such as concretization and metaphor, active art engagement, emotion processing and regulation, perspective taking and reframing, and therapeutic alliance, may improve symptoms of PTSD and prompt adaptive brain functioning. Given the scarcity of rigorous studies on art therapy's effectiveness and mechanisms of alleviating PTSD symptoms, the suggested framework offers a neurophysiological rationale and a future research agenda to investigate the impact of art therapy as a therapeutic approach for individuals with PTSD.Copyright © 2024 Malhotra, Jones, Spooner, Levy, Kaimal and Williamson.

T1  - Resource-Based Psychotherapy Model Application in the Treatment of Psychological Trauma Consequences
A1  - Rudenko O.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - ABSTRACT: The ongoing war in Ukraine significantly affects the mental and emotional well-being of its citizens. Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore the use of the resource psychotherapy model to develop effective support methods for trauma victims. The research aims to enrich the understanding of resource-based psychotherapy as an effective tool for supporting people who have experienced psychological trauma and improving their psychological well-being and quality of life. The analytical method, generalization, and systematization were used in this research. A clinical case of psychotherapy of a military man according to the 7-step model of working with the consequences of a psychotraumatic event is considered, which ultimately showed the effectiveness of its application. The study found that the resource psychotherapy model has significant potential for improving the psychological state of victims of trauma, as this approach allows the active use of internal resources of the individual to overcome the consequences of traumatic experiences and restore mental well-being. The results of the study indicate the effectiveness and deep potential of resource-based psychotherapy in working with people facing psychological trauma, helping them to build positive adaptation strategies and strengthen their psychological state. The results of this study may be useful for psychologists and psychotherapists working with people who have experienced traumatic experiences to improve the quality of psychological support and assistance to such people.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Background: Resident physicians at the standardized training stage had undergone significant physical and mental stress during the release of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions at the end of 2022 in China. This study aimed to investigate the psychological status (including anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, job burnout, and vicarious trauma) of resident physicians and identify its influencing factors under these special periods. Method(s): Survey was conducted one month after the release of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on resident training physicians from a tertiary first-class hospital in Zhejiang, China. Resident physicians completed the psychological status questionnaire. Chi-square tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the group differences and variable associations. Result(s): The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and somatic discomfort in this study was 20.88, 28.53, and 41.47%, respectively. Female resident physicians were more likely to experience somatic symptoms [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-4.18]. Resident physicians with problem-focused coping styles were less prone to psychological health issues [depression (adjusted OR =0.92, 95% CI: 0.88-0.96), anxiety (adjusted OR =0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.98), somatic symptoms (adjusted OR =0.93, 95% CI: 0.89-0.97), job burnout (adjusted OR =0.91, 95% CI: 0.87-0.96) and vicarious trauma (adjusted OR =0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.98)]. Inversely, resident physicians with emotion-focused coping styles and experienced negative life events were more prone to psychological health issues. Conclusion(s): Resident training physicians had a high risk of anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms under the special COVID-19 pandemic restriction release period. Females, with lower training stages, degrees, negative life events, and emotion-focused coping styles had a disadvantaged effect on psychological status. The medical teaching management department needs to monitor and reduce the workload and working hours of resident physicians, ensure sufficient sleep time, and pay attention to the psychological status of resident physicians. By strengthening regular communication and mental health education or intervention, which can help them improve their ability to cope with complex tasks.Copyright © 2024 Zhang, Pan, Pan, Qian, Zhou and Chen.

N2  - A scoping review on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and its impact on the families of affected children was undertaken due to insufficient information available on the diverse experiences impacting their lives. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, eligibility criteria were guided by Population (families), Concept (family experiences), and Context (African region). English-language articles were sought from a variety of databases and search engines. The publication date of the identified articles ranged from 2003 to 2021 with most published in 2020 (n=10), and the majority using qualitative methodologies (n=51). Most family members involved were parents (n=51) and their ages ranged from 18 to 75years. The families experienced various challenges related to their child with regard to education, healthcare, and the broader community including lack of support. Family coping strategies included believing in God, attending counseling sessions, adapting, and accepting the situation. Healthcare professionals should be prepared and positioned to educate families and siblings on various aspects of ASD. There is a need for active, continued research on families within most countries of World Health Organization Afro-region.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

N2  - Background and Purpose: Patients with COPD-induced malnutrition and muscle wasting are often frail. Consequently, traditional rehabilitation may be even counterproductive due to energy costs and there is a need for specialized rehabilitation programs, which are lacking for these patients. We developed such a program, which includes resistance training, following Nonlinear Periodized Exercise principles and physical energy management, in combination with a restriction of physical activities. The purpose of the study was to investigate the feasibility and the potential effects of this program. Method(s): Patients who are eligible for the program are those with COPD gold III/IV and a fat free mass index below standard. We conducted a qualitative feasibility study and interviewed both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs), using a deductive approach. The open interviews were qualitatively analyzed focussing on six areas of Bowens' feasibility model: acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, limited efficacy, and integration. Results and discussions: Seven patients and seven HCPs were interviewed. For patients, key factors that helped to adhere to the program were knowledge about energy management, alternative skills to cope with COPD, and social support. They found the program beneficial. However, several patients considered a limitation of walking and ADL activities challenging. HCPs considered the program feasible and beneficial especially for those patients who accept they need a behavior change and who adhere to the program. For HCPs, key factors were the consistent approach and coaching skills of the multidisciplinary team members, and the monitoring role of the nurses. The limitation of physical activity and endurance training deviates from existing geriatric rehabilitation programs which propagate functional activity and training. Still, evidence from the current study suggests that our tailored approach for these patients might be more appropriate and also potentially effective without harm for physical function. Conclusion(s): Our novel, multidisciplinary rehabilitation program is considered feasible and clinically relevant by both patients and healthcare professionals. The next step is to explore its effects on muscle strength, physical functioning, and quality of life.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - PURPOSE: Resident physicians experience high rates of burnout and depression but rarely prioritize their well-being or seek mental health care. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education mandated that training programs prioritize resident wellness and emotional and mental health to ensure readily available and accessible mental health care. To help meet that requirement and circumvent barriers to accessing care, the University of California San Diego Healer Education Assessment & Referral (HEAR) Program offers residents and fellows short-term therapy for coping with challenges that threaten their well-being. This report describes the results of a pilot study designed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the HEAR Program's resident therapy program. METHOD(S): The cohort included residents and fellows who completed at least 1 postbaseline assessment from January to May 2022. Measures of fulfillment, burnout, self-compassion, quality of life, depression, and suicidal ideation were assessed and compared before and up to 12 weeks after enrollment. RESULT(S): Of the 39 residents who consented to participation, 30 completed at least 1 postbaseline assessment. Most outcomes improved after therapy, with significant increases in fulfillment (mean [SE] coefficient, 0.24 [0.08]; z score, 2.86; P = .004), self-compassion (mean [SE] coefficient, 0.37 [0.07]; z score, 5.72; P < .001), and quality of life ( P < .001) and significant reductions in burnout (Stanford burnout scale: mean [SE] coefficient, -0.27 [0.07]; z score, -4.01; P < .001; single-item burnout scale: mean [SE] coefficient, -0.34 [0.08]; z score, -4.37; P < .001) and depression severity (mean [SE] coefficient, -1.08 [0.25]; z score, -4.36; P < .001). CONCLUSION(S): This pilot study noted improvements in fulfillment, compassion, quality of life, and function, as well as reductions in burnout and depression severity, among resident physicians. Future studies in larger cohorts are needed to validate these findings and inform further optimization of this program.Copyright © 2024 Written work prepared by employees of the Federal Government as part of their official duties is, under the U.S. Copyright Act, a "work of the United States Government" for which copyright protection under Title 17 of the United States Code is not available.

N2  - Background Little evidence exists on the treatment of traumatised refugees. Aims To estimate treatment effects of flexible cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressants (sertraline and mianserin) in traumatised refugees. Method Randomised controlled clinical trial with 2x2 factorial design (registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00917397, EUDRACT no. 2008-006714-15). Participants were refugees with war-related traumatic experiences, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and without psychotic disorder. Treatment was weekly sessions with a physician and/or psychologist over 6 months. Results A total of 217 of 280 patients completed treatment (78%). There was no effect on PTSD symptoms, no effect of psychotherapy and no interaction between psychotherapy and medicine. A small but significant effect of treatment with antidepressants was found on depression. Conclusions In a pragmatic clinical setting, there was no effect of flexible CBT and antidepressants on PTSD, and there was a small-tomoderate effect of antidepressants and psychoeducation on depression in traumatised refugees.Copyright © The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2016.

N2  - Aims and objectives: This study analyzes, in nurses, the influence of openness to experience and hardiness (assessed at baseline and one year after the COVID-19 pandemic respectively) on the development of optimism (assessed two years after the COVID-19 pandemic). Concerns about self-contagion were included as a moderating variable, given their relevance as a risk factor. Background(s): Nurses have been among the healthcare professionals most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most previous studies have focused on the variables contributing to psychological symptoms, whilst the attention given to the variables adding to the well-being of these professionals has been much scarcer. Design(s): A prospective study was carried out. Method(s): This study was carried out using three data collection periods: Period 1 (From May to June 2020), Period 2 (From January 2021 to April 2021), and Period 3 (From April 2022 to July 2022), with the participation of 151 Spanish nurses, using online self-reporting questionnaires. The study followed the STROBE statement. Result(s): The results showed that the proposed model was statistically significant. There was a positive effect of openness to experience (year 2020) on hardiness assessed one year later (year 2021). Similarly, hardiness had a positive effect on optimism assessed another year on (year 2022). Conclusion(s): Concerns about self-contagion behaved as a moderator in the relationship between openness to experience and hardiness (the relationship between openness and hardiness was statistically significant when contagion concern was higher). Relevance to clinical practice: In-depth understanding of the psychological processes that trigger psychological strengths (i.e. optimism) as a result of adverse situations (i.e. COVID-19 pandemic) is essential in promoting the mental health of healthcare professionals. Interventions targeting resilient personality traits and cognitive flexibility are key to this goal. No Patient or Public Contribution: The participants contributed exclusively to the collection of the sample.Copyright © 2024

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Purpose: This study investigates the impact of workplace bullying on nurses' psychological distress and the quality of care as well as the impact of resilience in mitigating the negative effect of workplace bullying. Design(s): A cross-sectional survey design was employed to study the phenomenon among a purposive sample of 326 nurses in the Ghanaian healthcare sector with self-administered questionnaires for data collection. Data was analyzed using IBM's Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27.0 and Process Macro Version. Result(s): The study found evidence that bullied nurses in hospitals often suffer from psychological distress. Results also demonstrate a negative link between workplace bullying and the quality of care delivered by nurses. Furthermore, the study found that resilience moderated the workplace bullying and nurses' psychological distress relationship, however, resilience is not a significant moderator in the workplace bullying and quality of care relationship. Originality: The study advances our understanding of workplace bullying's consequences for nurses in the Ghanaian healthcare sector. It underscores the importance of addressing workplace bullying, offering practical recommendations for healthcare administrators and managers. Fostering personal resources like resilience is crucial to empower nurses in facing the challenges of their workplace environment effectively.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s)

N2  - Objective: To investigate the experience of medical and graduate learners with second victim experience (SVE) after medical errors or adverse patient outcomes, including impact on training and identification of factors that shape their postevent recovery. Patients and Methods: The validated Second Victim Experience and Support Tool-Revised (SVEST-R), Physician Well-Being Index, and supplemental open-ended questions were administered to multidisciplinary health care learners between April 8, 2022, and May 30, 2022, across a large academic health institution. Open-ended responses were qualitatively analyzed for iterative themes related to impact of SVE on the training experience. Result(s): Of the 206 survey respondents, 144 answered at least 1 open-ended question, with 62.1% (n=91) reporting at least 1 SVE. Participants discussed a wide range of SVEs and indicated that their postevent response was influenced by their training environment. Lack of support from supervisors and staff exacerbated high stress situations. Some trainees felt blamed and unsupported after a traumatic experience. Others emphasized that positive training experiences and supportive supervisors helped them grow and regain confidence. Learners described postevent processing strategies helpful to their recovery. Some, however, felt disincentivized from seeking support. Conclusion(s): This multidisciplinary study of learners found that the training environment was influential in postevent recovery. Our findings support the need for the inclusion of education on SVEs and adaptive coping mechanisms as part of health care professional educational curriculums. Educators and health care staff may benefit from enhanced education on best practices to support trainees after stressful or traumatic patient events.Copyright © 2024 The Authors

T1  - Understanding the Role of Empathy and Gender on EMS Clinician Occupational Stress and Mental Health Outcomes
A1  - Schwartz M.
A1  - Berkowitz J.
A1  - McCann-Pineo M. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Emergency Medical Service (EMS) clinicians experience high levels of occupational stress due to long hours, short staffing, and patient deaths, among other factors. While gender has been partially examined, little is known regarding the role of empathy on occupational stress and mental health (MH) outcomes among EMS clinicians. Therefore, the current study examines the moderating role of empathy and, separately, gender on associations between occupational stress and mental health. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional examination of EMS clinician occupational and personal wellbeing was conducted via an anonymous, electronic survey. Information on clinician demographics, and validated measures of occupational stress, burnout, and MH outcomes were collected. Empathy was assessed using the Toronto Empathy Scale (TEQ). Descriptive/bivariate statistics were conducted for variables of interest. Separate multivariable regression models evaluated associations between occupational stress and mental health outcomes. Empathy and gender were examined as potential moderators using interactions. RESULT(S): A total of 568 EMS clinicians completed the survey. High levels of mental health difficulties were reported (34.0% anxiety, 29.2% depression, 48.6% burnout). Increased occupational stress was associated with increased anxiety (OR =1.08, 95% CI 1.05-1.10), depression (OR=1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.10), and burnout (OR=1.10, 95% CI 1.07-1.12). No moderation analyses were significant. Greater resilience was associated with lower depression, anxiety, and burnout. CONCLUSION(S): EMS clinicians, much like other first responders, experience considerable occupational stress, of which is associated with mental health difficulties and burnout. Findings underscore the need for intervention programs aimed at reducing the impact of occupational stress and the promotion of resilience. Continuing to understand the full scope of EMS mental health, including the role of resilience, is imperative, particularly in light of future public emergencies.

N2  - Background Enduring ethnic inequalities exist in mental healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic has widened these. Aims To explore stakeholder perspectives on how the COVID-19 pandemic has increased ethnic inequalities in mental healthcare. Method A qualitative interview study of four areas in England with 34 patients, 15 carers and 39 mental health professionals from National Health Service (NHS) and community organisations (July 2021 to July 2022). Framework analysis was used to develop a logic model of inter-relationships between pre-pandemic barriers and COVID-19 impacts. Results Impacts were largely similar across sites, with some small variations (e.g. positive service impacts of higher ethnic diversity in area 2). Pre-pandemic barriers at individual level included mistrust and thus avoidance of services and at a service level included the dominance of a monocultural model, leading to poor communication, disengagement and alienation. During the pandemic remote service delivery, closure of community organisations and media scapegoating exacerbated existing barriers by worsening alienation and communication barriers, fuelling prejudice and division, and increasing mistrust in services. Some minority ethnic patients reported positive developments, experiencing empowerment through self-determination and creative activities. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic some patients showed resilience and developed adaptations that could be nurtured by services. However, there has been a reduction in the availability of group-specific NHS and third-sector services in the community, exacerbating pre-existing barriers. As these developments are likely to have long-term consequences for minority ethnic groups' engagement with mental healthcare, they need to be addressed as a priority by the NHS and its partners.Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

N2  - Introduction: Many breast cancer treatments induce or exacerbate menopausal symptoms. 60-70% of patients report severe menopause symptoms, reducing compliance with endocrine therapies. Only 50-80% complete their advised adjuvant treatment, which may impact survival. Breast care nurses advise on conservative symptom management, however recognise for many this is inadequate. Evidence has demonstrated cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can reduce the severity and frequency of treatment side effects. Method(s): We developed a nurse-led 6-week peer group CBT programme to manage menopausal symptoms associated with breast cancer treatment. Breast care nurses completed training in delivery of CBT. Here we present experience of our first cycle of the programme. Result(s): 9 patients with troublesome symptoms were identified through follow up clinic/ breast care nurse contact; all agreed to participation. Patient engagement was high; 6 of 9 completing the full programme (67%) and a further 2 partially participating. Median age was 53 (range 36-56) with median interval 23 months from diagnosis (range 7-72). 7 of 9 (78%) patients were pre-menopausal at diagnosis and most had ER+ HER2- disease (8/9, 89%). Commonest symptoms pre-CBT included hot flushes, arthralgia and vaginal atrophy. Conclusion(s): Patient satisfaction with peer CBT sessions was high with majority engaging and completing the full 6-week course. Patients acquired effective tools to manage emotional challenges associated with menopause and strategies to cope with stress, anxiety and mood changes; gaining insight into thought patterns and techniques to reframe them positively. Connecting with individuals navigating similar experiences cultivates a supportive community and mutual understanding.Copyright © 2024

N2  - BACKGROUND: Understanding moral distress and resilience is crucial for supporting the well-being of emergency nursing staff and improving patient care. However, there is limited research specifically examining moral distress and resilience among emergency nursing staff in ARAR city hospitals. AIMS: This study aims to examine moral distress and resilience levels among emergency nursing staff in ARAR city hospitals. Specifically, the study seeks to determine the correlation between moral distress and resilience among emergency nursing staff and examine differences in the levels of moral distress and resilience among different demographic and occupational characteristics. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study design was employed, involving a non-probability stratified sample of emergency nursing staff from two hospitals in ARAR city. The participants completed a Brazilian Moral Distress Scale in Nurses (MDSN-BR) and Rushton Moral Resilience Scale in Nurses (RMRS). Statistical analyses, including descriptive statistics and one-way- ANOVA, were conducted to analyze the data. RESULT(S): The study found that emergency nursing had a moderate level of moral distress, with a mean frequency of 2.70 (SD=1.02) and a mean intensity of 2.79 (SD=1.04). The overall self-reported moral resilience was also moderate, with a mean score of 2.48 (SD=0.77). Significant positive correlations were observed between resilience and both moral distress frequency (r=0.48, p=0.001) and intensity (r=0.48, p=0.001). Educational levels and nursing positions were associated with variations in moral distress and resilience. Postgraduate diploma emergency nursing reported the highest levels of moral distress frequency (3.12, SD=1.14) and intensity (3.21, SD=1.16). A bachelor's degree in nursing exhibited higher levels of personal integrity (3.06, SD=0.87), while a master's degree in nursing showed higher levels of moral efficacy (2.88, SD=1.09). Head nurses experienced higher levels of moral distress compared to other positions (3.08, SD=1.37 for frequency; 3.18, SD=1.29 for intensity). CONCLUSION(S): The study revealed that emergency nursing experienced relatively moderate levels of moral distress, which could be attributed to insufficient multidisciplinary teams and unprepared actions. The findings also highlighted moderate levels of moral resilience, particularly in relational integrity. Educational levels and nursing positions were found to influence moral distress and resilience. These results underscore the need for targeted interventions to support the well-being of emergency nurses and enhance ethical decision-making.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) will require insulin for glycemic control during their disease. Objective(s): We evaluated the willingness to start insulin therapy among insulin-naive persons with DM2 in urban Northern Uganda. Design(s): A facility-based, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted between June and August 2023 recruiting insulin-naive type 2 diabetes mellitus patients attending routine health care at Gulu Regional Referral Hospital, Gulu, Uganda. Method(s): We gauged participants' willingness to use insulin by asking, 'If your doctor prescribed insulin for you, would you accept to use it?' with responses categorized as either 'Yes' or 'No'. Poisson regression analysis was performed to assess the factors associated with willingness to start insulin therapy. p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Result(s): We enrolled 190 participants, with a mean age of 55 +/- 12.72 years. Most participants were female (63.7%, n = 121), attained a primary level of education (70.0%, n = 133), and were unemployed (84.2%, n = 160). Overall, 73.4% (n = 138) of the participants were willing to receive insulin therapy if indicated. Participants recently advised on insulin showed a 34% higher willingness [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR): 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.72, p = 0.007], whereas those with a disease duration of 6 years or more were 43% less willing (aPR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.39-0.81, p = 0.002) and those concerns about coping with insulin therapy were 55% less willing to commence insulin therapy (aPR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.39-0.81, p = 0.002). Conclusion(s): About three in every four participants with DM were willing to receive insulin if indicated. However, healthcare providers should consider personalized counseling strategies to alleviate concerns and enhance informed decision-making regarding insulin initiation. Future interventions should focus on addressing specific barriers associated with prolonged disease duration and apprehensions related to insulin therapy to optimize glycemic control in this population.Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic posed particular challenges for patients with diabetes and their care management, especially those in LMICs. In the post pandemic era, it is crucial to understand the impact of the pandemic on diabetes management from a health system perspective, and strengthen regional and national capacity to build resilient diabetes management system in LMICs. Aim(s): This study used China, a middle-income country having the highest number of diabetics globally, as an example to reveal the influence of the pandemic on diabetes management and show theway forward to control the diabetes in the post pandemic era in LMICs. Method(s): Eligible studies published during December 2019 and July, 2023 were searched on databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINHAL Complete, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang. TheWHOHealth System frameworkwere used to summarized the impact of the pandemic on diabetes management system. Result(s): Most of the included studies revealed the negative impact of the pandemic on three health system blocks -workforce, service delivery, and medicine access. Clinicians' efforts were channeled toward containing the state of the pandemic, resulting in limited healthcare personnel to help diabetes patients manage their condition. Despite telehealth initiatives, services were constrained and slowed down to address acute and chronic issues for patients with diabetes. Access to essential medicine remains an issue facing by diabetes patients, mainly by those encountering financial hardship, which were common among younger people, especially in suburban areas. There was few reports on the impact of the pandemic on health information system, financing, leadership/governance change for diabetes management during the COVID pandemic. Conclusion(s): The understanding of the short- and long-term impact of the pandemic on the diabetes management system in LMICs is still limited. Future research is urgently needed to help strengthen all the six health system blocks to effectively combat the diabetes crisis in LMICs.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Diabetes could affect more than 1.31 billion people by 2050 worldwide. In 2021, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounted for 96% of the total global diabetes prevalence. People with T2DM often experience diabetes distress, which is associated to higher risk for complications and mortality and poorer disease management. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could further amplify their vulnerability to adverse diabetes distress. The COVID-19 pandemic and strategies aimed to curb its spread in China, such as self-quarantine, might directly and indirectly exacerbate diabetes distress. As optimal health in diabetes requires continuous and active self-management, addressing diabetes distress is imperative. Resilience and self-efficacy are positive psychological characteristics found linked to alleviated diabetes distress, but the influencing pathways have not been fully investigated yet. Aim(s): To examine the mediating role of self-efficacy between resilience and diabetes distress in people with T2DM. Method(s): 330 patients with T2DM were recruited from 13 community health centers in outskirts of Beijing in this crosssectional study. Self-reported questionnaires containing demographic characteristics, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale (DMSES) and Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) were used to collect data. Result(s): Of 330 patients (56% male, 52.4 +/- 7.8 years), the mean score of CD-RISC is 63.8, 55.6% have low or middle level of self-efficacy (DMSES<80%), and 30% have moderate diabetes distress (mean DDS >=2). Bootstrapping results indicated that both the direct (beta = -0.0061, P = 0.0047) and indirect (beta = -0.0048, LLCI = -0.0080, ULCI = -0.0024) effect of resilience on diabetes distress was significant, and management self-efficacy mediated the association between them. Conclusion(s): Better resilience and management self-efficacy may alleviate diabetes distress. Under the long and lasting influence of COVID-19, healthcare providers should develop interventions improving not only resilience, but also self-efficacy to help patients with T2DM improve diabetes distress.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objectives: To compare the prevalence of anxiety/depression, resilience, and social support among nurses, foreign domestic helpers (FDHs), and residents living in subdivided units (SDUs), and to examine their associations in these high-risk groups in Hong Kong during Omicron waves. Method(s): We recruited 1,014 nurses, 621 FDHs, and 651 SDU residents from December 2021 to May 2022 in this cross-sectional survey. The depression, anxiety, social support, and resilience levels were measured by the validated scales. The multivariate binary logistic regression and causal mediation analysis were applied to examine the associations. Result(s): We observed a prevalence of 17.7% in anxiety and 21.6% in depression which were the highest in SDU residents, followed by FDHs, and lowest in nurses. Social support was associated with increased resilience levels and decreased risks of anxiety/depression. The association of social support with mental disorders was partly mediated by resilience, accounting for 30.9% and 20.9% of the total effect of social support on anxiety and depression, respectively. Conclusion(s): Public health strategies should target improving social support and providing resilience-promoting interventions to help reduce mental disorders in vulnerable groups.Copyright © 2024 Wong, Qiu, Sun, Mo, Lai, Yam, Miao, Cheung and Yeoh.

N2  - The aim of this study was to examine the effects of prolonged exposure to emergency situations during the pandemic on the mental health of nurses/technicians, focusing on burnout and post-traumatic stress symptoms, and the effects of psychological resilience levels on their overall life satisfaction. A total of 125 nurses/technicians participated in the study conducted at the Department of Health Studies of the University of Split in Croatia. The burnout syndrome level was examined using the Burnout Intensity Questionnaire, the post-traumatic stress symptoms were assessed using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, psychological resilience was assessed using the Brief Resilience Scale, while overall life satisfaction was measured using the Life Satisfaction Scale. After working for two years amid the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 30% of nurses/technicians reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and a high level of burnout. Neither burnout nor posttraumatic stress symptoms were found to be associated with life satisfaction. However, psychological resilience was positively associated with life satisfaction, even after controlling for the effects of burnout and post-traumatic stress. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an immense burden on healthcare systems worldwide, with high rates of burnout and PTSD symptoms among healthcare professionals. The importance of psychological resilience is emphasized as a factor in promoting mental health among healthcare professionals.Copyright © 2023 Medicinska Naklada Zagreb. All rights reserved.

N2  - The family caregiver of a person with Alzheimer's disease still experiences, in most cases, negative consequences in their biopsychosocial environment, which are related to the acquisition of this role. However, it has been observed that this fact is not universal in this type of population since benefits can be obtained in the act of caring through the development of resilience. Given this possibility and given that nurses are the health professionals who support people in this illness process, there is an urgent need to identify which non-pharmacological interventions could improve or promote resilience in family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, our overall objective was to determine which interventions are useful in promoting resilience in family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease through a scoping review. The data were analysed using an adapted version of Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework, after critically reading the articles with the CasP and MMAT tools. Nine articles were included (five analytical experimental, two quantitative and two mixed). Three types of interventions related to promoting resilience in family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease were identified: meditation, multicomponent psychoeducation and creative art; nurses participated as co-therapists in the last two.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.

N2  - The 16-item Physical Resilience Instrument for Older Adults (PRIFOR) has good clinimetric properties; however, a shortened PRIFOR would greatly enhance physical resilience measurements in clinical settings. The current analysis aimed to reduce the number of PRIFOR while maintaining its clinimetric properties, emphasizing on its factor structure and convergent validity. A longitudinal study was conducted among 863 patients aged 65 years or older. Four PRIFOR items with high factor loadings were selected to generate the short version of PRIFOR (PRIFOR-4). The PRIFOR-4 was found to have a unidimensional structure (comparative fit index = 0.999; Tucker-Lewis index = 0.998 in the confirmatory factor analysis results) with good convergent validity with various external measures (absolute r = 0.109-0.597; p-values<0.01). Because the PRIFOR-4 contains only four items, the completion time for the respondents reduced three fourths from the original PRIFOR, which may have a marked reduction in the response burden. The PRIFOR-4 is thus an easy-to-use measurement that saves time for healthcare professionals in clinical practice.Copyright © 2024 The Authors

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Little research explores military perspectives on medical disability-related transition. A qualitative study sought to understand transition experiences of United States military Service members found unfit for duty following medical and physical evaluation boards (MEBs and PEBs). METHOD(S): Confidential telephone interviews were conducted with 25 current and prior Service members. Participants were asked to share their experiences before, during, and after the MEB and PEB processes. Interview questions explored (1) health conditions that prompted the medical disability evaluation, (2) reactions to being recommended for separation, (3) transition-related stress and challenges, and (4) coping strategies. Salient themes were identified across chronological narratives. RESULT(S): Participants expressed that debilitating physical (e.g., injury) and/or mental (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder) illnesses prompted their medical evaluation. In response to the unfit for duty notice, some participants reported emotional distress (e.g., anxiety, anger) connected to uncertainty about the future. Other participants reported relief connected to a sense of progression toward their medical disability claim status. Transition stress included the length of the MEB/PEB process, impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the process, financial stress, impact on family life, and compounded effect of these stressors on emotional distress, including depression and suicidal thoughts. Participants reported using adaptive (e.g., psychotherapy) and maladaptive (e.g., excessive drinking) strategies to cope with stress. CONCLUSION(S): Preliminary reports of emotional distress and transition stress following unfit for duty notices highlight the need for increased support and interventions to facilitate adaptive coping strategies during this vulnerable period.Copyright © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - Rationale: Psychological resilience (the ability to thrive in adversity) may protect against mental-health symptoms in healthcare professionals during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) waves. Objective(s): To identify determinants of resilience in ICU staff members. Method(s): In this cross-sectional survey in 21 French ICUs, staff members completed the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (for post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]). Factors independently associated with resilience were identified. Measurements and Main Results: The response rate was 73.1% (950 of 1,300). The median 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale score was 29 (interquartile range, 25-32). Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were present in 61%, 39%, and 36% of staff members, respectively. Distress associated with the COVID-19 infodemic was correlated with, symptoms of depression and PTSD. More resilient respondents less often had symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Greater resilience was independently associated with male sex, having provided intensive care during the early waves, having managed more than 50 patients with COVID-19, and, compared with earlier waves, working longer hours, having greater motivation, and more often involving families in end-of-life decisions. Independent risk factors for lower resilience were having managed more than 10 patients who died of COVID-19, having felt frightened or isolated, and greater distress from the COVID-19 infodemic. Conclusion(s): This study identifies modifiable determinants of resilience among ICU staff members. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether prior resilience decreases the risk of mental ill health during subsequent challenges. Hospital and ICU managers, for whom preserving mental well-being among staff members is a key duty, should pay careful attention to resilience.Copyright © 2024 American Thoracic Society.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Stress is inevitable in the nursing profession, and ways of coping are one of the solutions to reduce stress. Social support is one of the influencing factors on coping strategies, but there is probably a difference between the effects of received or perceived social support on coping strategies. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim was to investigate the relationship between received and perceived social support with ways of coping in nurses. METHOD(S): This is a cross-sectional descriptive-correlational study. The sample consisted of 292 nurses by simple random sampling. The data collection tool included Zimmet's multidimensional perceived social support scale, McCain and Marklin's perceived social support questionnaire, and Lazarus' ways of coping questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation and multiple regression tests in SPSS v.22. RESULT(S): The results showed that received social support (beta= 0.20, p <  0.001) and perceived social support (beta= 0.35, p <  0.001) are able to explain changes in the dimension of seeking social support. Received social support (beta= 0.16, p = 0.005) and perceived social support (beta= 0.22, p <  0.001) are able to explain changes after positive reappraisal, but only received social support could explain changes in accepting responsibility (beta= 0.15, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION(S): This study showed that received and perceived social support have a significant correlation with ways of coping, but only able to explain the changes in social support seeking dimensions, positive reappraisal, accepting responsibility. Both types of social support are necessary, but that received social support covered more adaptive coping strategies.

N2  - Background: Children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer often experience psychological distress, encompassing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of these conditions among Omani children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer, alongside identifying contributing factors. Method(s): A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2021 to June 2023 among a cohort of Omani children and adolescents (6-18 years old) diagnosed with cancer at three primary cancer referral centres in Oman. Validated Arabic-language versions of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised instruments were used to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, respectively. An initial assessment (T1) was undertaken within the first 3 months of diagnosis, followed by a second assessment (T2) 3-6 months later. Result(s): Of 113 eligible participants, 101 agreed to participate in the study (response rate: 95.6%), with 92 (91.0%) completing both assessments and included in the final analysis. Prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and PTSD decreased from 43.5%, 56.5%, and 32.6%, respectively, at T1, to 38.0%, 35.9%, and 23.9% at T2. All average scores were below diagnostic cut-off points, except for the depression score at T1. Anxiety and depression scores decreased significantly (p = 0.043 and 0.001, respectively) between T1 and T2, as did the overall prevalence of depression (p = 0.004). At T1, linear regression analysis showed significant correlations between anxiety scores and the child's age and PTSD score (p < 0.05); these variables were also correlated with depression scores (p <= 0.001). At T2, significant correlations were observed between anxiety scores and the child's age and PTSD scores (p < 0.001). At both T1 and T2, anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores remained significantly correlated (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Omani children and adolescents recently diagnosed with cancer exhibit a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD over time. Age-appropriate communication, ongoing support, and mental health services are recommended to help this patient group cope with their diagnosis and manage their emotional wellbeing. There is a need for future research to determine the effectiveness of specific psychological interventions in reducing the frequency of these disorders.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - Objective/Aim: Patients receiving long-term care (LTC) services are at higher risk for social determinants of health (SODH) disparities. Strategic public-private partnerships (P3) facilitate collaborations to reduce health inequities. As the largest integrated health care system, the organization is invested in achieving health equity for all Veterans through robust P3 that address SDOH, increasing access to (1) high-quality care; (2) healthy foods; (3) training and employment resources; and (4) civic participation and social-cohesion opportunities. Background(s): ~80% of Veterans need LTC support in their lifetime. Seniors, people with disabilities, and those receiving LTC are vulnerable to health disparities. Achieving health equity requires recognizing the impact of SODH and implementing interventions that address these root causes. Veteran SDOH, which shape health outcomes, closely mirror the factors affecting the general population. Quality Improvement Methods: The health system supports emerging healthcare advancement initiatives (HAIs) through implementation of impactful field-based partnerships. Robust partnerships aim to eliminate health disparities aligned with SDOH, to achieve increased access to (1) high-quality care; (2) healthy foods; (3) training and employment resources; and (4) civic participation and social-cohesion opportunities. Result(s): (1) Partnership with a video streaming company improved Veteran health information access. The digital platform connects Veterans to hundreds of leading physicians across 37 specialties and expands access to video channels developed by renowned medical institutes. (2) Partnership with a science-driven philanthropic organization addresses food insecurity and promotes healthy eating habits. Provides eligible Veterans $100 monthly stipend for fresh produce, nutrition education, and coaching from registered dietitians. (3) Partnership with a large cloud-based software company provides resources to Service members transitioning to civilian life. Provides online training on Veteran benefits, certifications for technology-based careers, professional development courses, and access to employment opportunities. Over 55,000 Veterans and their families have benefited including over 30,000 trained with the technology courses and over 16,000 completed benefits and mental health resiliency modules. (4) Initiative promoting partnerships in rural areas to strengthen interpersonal connections and provide civic engagement activities for transitioning Veterans. One partner hosted 223 programs providing socialization and camaraderie opportunities to disabled veterans in rural areas. Conclusion(s): The health system is at the forefront of addressing Veteran health equity in LTC by recognizing the influence of SDOH and implementing innovative initiatives and P3. This commitment extends quality healthcare services to millions of Veterans. Through strategic partnerships, the organization is committed to numerous initiatives to improve health equity at the local, state, and national levels.Copyright © 2024

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Nurses in intensive care units (ICUs) face high stress and anxiety, impacting their well-being and productivity. Addressing this, this study evaluated the impact of resilience training via a mHealth application based on micro-learning on ICU nurses' stress and anxiety levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study, a single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted in 2022-23, involved sixty ICU nurses from two Tehran hospitals. Nurses were chosen through purposive sampling and divided into intervention and control groups by simple randomization. The intervention group was taught resilience via an educational mHealth application based on micro-learning, with data collected using the anxiety and stress subscales of DASS-21. RESULT(S): Before the intervention, there were no significant differences in stress and anxiety scores between the intervention and control groups (P>0.05). Upon utilizing the mHealth application, the intervention group exhibited significant reductions in stress, from 10.77+/-3.33 to 9.00+/-1.66 (P=0.001), and in anxiety, from 9.43+/-3.35 to 7.93+/-0.98 (P<0.001). In contrast, the control group experienced a slight increase in stress levels, from 10.10+/-2.19 to 10.73+/-2.15 (P=0.002), and in anxiety levels, from 9.10+/-1.63 to 10.23+/-1.65 (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION(S): The micro-learning-based mHealth application for resilience training significantly reduced ICU nurses' stress and anxiety, recommending its adoption as an innovative educational method. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study has been registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (No. IRCT20221225056916N1, Date: 04/29/2023).Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Bryophyllum preparations are widely used in anthroposophic medicine, most often for mental and behavioural disorders. Three prospective studies have revealed positive effects of Bryophyllum pinnatum on sleep quality, and various trials have shown very good tolerability. Results from animal models have indicated CNS depressant and anxiolytic effects. This survey was conducted at the hospital "Klinik Arlesheim"in Switzerland to find out how the physicians and the nursing staff perceive the effectiveness and the tolerability of the Bryophyllum preparations they most frequently use. Design(s): Internal, anonymous online survey of healthcare professionals (April 8 May 31, 2022). The questionnaire comprised 105 multiple-choice questions. Answering the questions was taken as consent to participate in the survey. Participants and Methods: All physicians and nursing staff with a valid email address at the hospital "Klinik Arlesheim AG"were invited via email to participate in this REDCap survey. The data were analysed descriptively. Result(s): Out of 266 invited participants, 48 answered some and 36 answered all questions (response rate between 18.0% and 13.5%). The participants had long experience with Bryophyllum preparations and were comprised approximately equal numbers of physicians and nursing staff. Various Bryophyllum preparations from the hospital s own production and Wala Heilmittel GmbH (in both cases produced from the species B. daigremontianum) and from Weleda AG (species B. pinnatum) were used. The indications for which most participants had prescribed or administered Bryophyllum preparations "very frequently"were anxiety, sleep disorders, crisis situations in oncology, posttraumatic stress disorder, benzodiazepine dependence/ withdrawal, and depression. Improvements such as relief from restlessness, decreased anxiety, balance, easier falling asleep, better sleeping through, increased resilience, mood elevation, and less urge to move one s legs were reported "frequently"or "very frequently."Almost all participants agreed that Bryophyllum can be used to reduce the intake of synthetic sedatives or psychotropic drugs, but only approximately half believed that it could replace them. The majority of participants mentioned good tolerability of the various products, but a few reported occasional stomach or intestinal irritation, daytime fatigue, drowsiness, diarrhoea, and nausea. Conclusion(s): Bryophyllum preparations are perceived as helpful in the treatment of various mental disorders, particularly anxiety, and are generally well tolerated. Most of these preparations are used for indications that have not yet been clinically investigated. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - Exposure to patients who have experienced major traumatic events places burn therapists at risk of developing high levels of anxiety and stress, directly impacting their quality of life. Poor professional quality of life has been associated with negative physical and emotional characteristics in healthcare professionals and may subsequently influence patient safety and satisfaction, job retention, and productivity. The purpose of this study was to understand and describe the experiences of occupational and physical therapists who provide acute therapy to people who have sustained burn injuries. Semistructured interviews were completed with 10 participants (8 females and 7 physical therapists) for this qualitative descriptive study. Conventional content analysis was used to analyze the data collected from semistructured interviews. Six themes emerged after content analysis: (1) the importance of therapeutic relationships to patient successes and therapists' retention; (2) the autonomy and flexibility of burn therapists; (3) the impact of career longevity on compassion; (4) the uniqueness of burn team relationships and camaraderie; (5) the challenges of operating within the business of a healthcare system; and (6) the physical, mental, and emotional challenges to the burn therapists' resiliency. This research brings to light the physical, mental, and emotional challenges that impact burn therapists' resiliency, and which should be considered when creating programs to increase retention and professional quality of life in this professional population.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - AIM: This study aimed to assess the association between psychological reactions (e.g., stress, anxiety, and depression), resilience, and work engagement among Palestinian critical care nurses in the West Bank and examine the correlation of psychological reactions and resilience with work engagement. BACKGROUND: Work engagement is associated with psychological reactions and resilience, particularly among critical care nurses. There is a lack of studies on work engagement and these factors in Palestine. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional, descriptive correlational design was adopted. A convenience sample consisting of 273 critical care nurses from private and governmental hospitals was recruited to participate. Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-25 (CDRS-25), Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-9 (UWES-9), and demographic data were used to collect data during the period from March 20 to May 20, 2023. RESULT(S): Findings demonstrated that 53.9% of the nurses reported mild-to-moderate levels of depression, 49.8% reported moderate-to-severe levels of anxiety, and 49.1% reported moderate-to-severe levels of stress. Additionally, 57.5% and 52.7% of them had low resilience and work engagement, respectively. Moreover, work engagement negatively correlated with depression (r = -0.796, P < 0.01), anxiety (r = -0.654, P < 0.01), and stress (r = -0.796, P < 0.01), while positively correlated with resilience (r = 0.42, P < 0.01) and gender (r = 0.121, P < 0.05). Depression, anxiety, stress, resilience, and gender were the main predictors of work engagement. DISCUSSION: The majority of the nurses suffered from depression, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, more than half of the participants had low resilience and work engagement. Moreover, increased depression, anxiety, and stress were correlated with decreased work engagement, while high resilience and gender as being female positively correlated with high work engagement. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Policymakers and hospital administrators should develop interventions to improve critical care nurses' resilience and minimize psychological reactions, which have a significant influence on work engagement. Future studies should be conducted to examine the effectiveness of these interventions.Copyright © 2024 International Council of Nurses.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Workplace violence (WPV) against emergency nurses has been common but unavoidable. Promoting resilience may mitigate the subsequent health harms of workplace violence. Current interventions mainly focused on internal factors related to resilience, though the external factors can influence personal growth. AIM: To test the effect, feasibility, and acceptability of a Comprehensive Active Resilience Education (CARE) program on promoting resilience in emergency nurses exposed to workplace violence. DESIGN: This is a two-armed quasi-experimental using mixed methods, following the TREND checklist. METHOD(S): This study was conducted from March 2023 to July 2023 in a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. Emergency nurses exposed to workplace violence were recruited using cluster sampling and allocated to the intervention and control groups. The intervention group received the CARE program. The control group received no intervention. RESULT(S): 71participants were recruited and no participants withdrew during the intervention. The resilience and anxiety scores displayed a significant effect in the group*time interaction effect. After four months, the intervention group demonstrated a significant improvement in resilience and anxiety scores. The intervention group showed greater improvement in coping, perceived organizational support, and depression scores compared to the control group. Two themes of joyful engagement experience and effective intervention were identified from qualitative interviews with the intervention group. CONCLUSION(S): The Comprehensive Active Resilience Education (CARE) program was effective, feasible, and acceptable in increasing resilience in emergency nurses exposed to workplace violence. The CARE program we developed can be replicated and integrated into systematic education programs for all nurses to help them maintain their mental health and good job performance while dealing with workplace violence.Copyright © 2024.

N2  - Law enforcement officers are routinely exposed to high-threat encounters that elicit physiological stress responses that impact health, performance, and safety. Therefore, self-regulation using evidence-based approaches is a priority in police research and practice. This paper describes a five-module heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) protocol that is part of a larger resilience program (the International Performance Resilience and Efficiency Program - iPREP) established in 2014. Supported by 10 years of user-informed research and development, our methods are tailored to address occupational stressors and the practical realities of training and resource availability in operational settings. Building on existing clinical methods that comprise five to six weekly sessions and up to 40-min of daily practice, our iPREP HRVB protocol is typically delivered in a condensed format across 2-3 days and is seamlessly integrated with reality-based training scenarios commonly employed in policing. By combining best practices in clinical HRVB with police-specific pedagogical frameworks, officers receive accelerated and job-relevant training to adaptively modulate autonomic responses to acute and chronic stress. Efficacy of the iPREP HRVB protocol is supported by several research studies of various methodological designs (i.e., randomized control trial, longitudinal cohort) that demonstrate immediate and sustained improvements in police performance and physiological health outcomes. We conclude with a critical appraisal of the available empirical evidence contrasting common and emerging breathing techniques proposed for use in operational policing contexts. The critical appraisal guide is intended to serve as a resource for law enforcement agencies, governing bodies, and operators when choosing appropriate and effective self-regulation training approaches.Copyright © 2024.

N2  - Patients with long-term disease experience low resilience, emphasising the importance of psychological interventions to improve resilience. However, there is no comprehensive evidence on the efficacy of resilience-related psychological interventions (RRPIs) in this population. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate and extend knowledge from previous meta-analyses on the efficacy of RRPIs on resilience, stress, anxiety, depression and quality of life among patients with long-term disease. Cochrane Library, Embase, Ovid-MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CINAHL electronic databases were searched until 3 February 2023. The pooled effect size of the efficacy of RRPIs was calculated using the Hedges' g (g) with random-effects model, while Cochrane Q-statistics and I2 tests assessed heterogeneity in Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0 software. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool evaluated the quality of studies. Moderator analysis was used to explore sources of heterogeneity. Twenty randomised controlled trial studies were identified, representing a total of 1388 individuals with long-term disease. RRPIs significantly enhance resilience (g=0.79), alleviate stress (g=-0.78), decrease anxiety (g=-1.14), mitigate depression (g=-0.96) and improve quality of life (g=0.48). Positive psychology, mindfulness, cognitive behavioural therapy, acceptance and commitment-based intervention exhibited medium effects in strengthening resilience. Short-term effects of RRPIs on enhancing resilience were observed at 3-month follow-up period (g=0.50). The incorporation of RRPIs into the management of patients with long-term disease shows a positive impact on their resilience, stress, anxiety, depression and quality of life. The results offer an evidence-based foundation for nurses in promoting resilience among patients with long-term disease.Copyright © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The urgency and risk of clinical nursing may cause nurses to experience traumatic stress, but it may also lead to posttraumatic growth. However, no study has comprehensively analyzed the prevalence of posttraumatic growth among nurses using a unified outcome measure and a validated assessment tool. AIM: This study aims to systematically assess the prevalence and factors of posttraumatic growth among nurses based on the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). METHOD(S): Ten databases, including The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Springerlink, Embase, Chinese Biomedical (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, and VIP databases, were searched as of December 31, 2022. The prevalence of posttraumatic growth was pooled using Stata 17.0 software. The PRISMA guideline was used to report the systematic review and meta-analysis. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022365620. RESULT(S): A total of 30 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis, consisting of 14,022 nurses worldwide from four countries. In our study, the pooled mean score of posttraumatic growth among nurses was 66.34 (95% CI: 61.25-71.43). From 2015 to 2022, nurses' posttraumatic growth levels gradually increased. In addition, Turkey nurses have the lowest posttraumatic growth levelnurses who experienced workplace violence have a lower posttraumatic growth level compared with other nurses; while nurses aged over 30 and male have higher posttraumatic growth levels. CONCLUSION(S): While several studies on the prevalence of posttraumatic growth among nurses have been published, the reported data are quite different. Our systematic review and meta-analysis found that nurses' posttraumatic growth level was "moderate," and nurses' posttraumatic growth may vary based on publication year, country, traumatic event, age, and gender. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Our findings may provide a theoretical basis for hospital administrators and policy makers to scientifically manage human resources, comprehensively evaluate nurses' mental health, and promote nurses' posttraumatic growth in different traumatic events, which is conducive to the formulation and implementation of relevant policy guidelines.Copyright © 2024 International Council of Nurses.

T1  - Neurological Health in Sexual and Gender Minority Individuals

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Despite representing a significant proportion of the U.S. population, there is a paucity of population-based research on the health status and health needs of sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals in neurology. Compared with heterosexual peers, some SGM populations have a higher burden of chronic health conditions. In parallel, SGM individuals are more likely to experience stigma and discrimination producing psychological distress, which may contribute to and be compounded by reduced health care access and utilization. In this narrative review, we summarize the existing literature on common neurological health conditions such as stroke, headache, epilepsy, movement disorders, and traumatic brain injury through the lens of intersection of SGM identity. Special focus is attuned to social determinants of health and gender-affirming hormonal therapy. Given the limitations in the available literature, there is an urgent unmet need for datasets that include sexual orientation and gender identity information, as well as funding for research that will characterize the prevalence of neurological conditions, unique risk factors, and health outcomes in SGM populations. In the health care community, providers should address deficiencies in their professional training and integrate inclusive language into their clinical skillset to build trust with SGM patients. There is an opportunity in neurology to proactively engage SGM communities, collaborate to remove barriers to care, promote resilience, and develop targeted interventions to ensure high-quality, culturally competent care for SGM populations to improve neurological health for all.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - Objectives: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face challenges that impact their physical, mental, and social wellbeing, emotion regulation, and coping. Mindfulness reduces stress and improves resilience, emotion regulation, and executive functioning. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) teach the practice of mindfulness to foster present-moment attention without judgement and enhance self-observation and self-regulation, resulting in greater awareness of thoughts and emotions and improved interpersonal relationships. One such intervention,.b, has been shown to lower stress among youth. While a pilot study of.b among sheltered youth found the intervention to be feasible, the need for modifications was identified to improve its relevance, accessibility, and incorporate a trauma-informed approach. Method(s): We used the ADAPT-ITT (Assessment, Decisions, Administration, Production, Topical experts, Integration, Training staff, and Testing) framework to adapt the.b mindfulness intervention to YEH living in an emergency shelter. Nine focus group discussions (n = 56), key informant interviews (n = 8), and beta testing with five youth working group sessions (n = 10) identified needed modifications. Result(s): Adaptations to the curriculum and delivery modality were made to approximate the average length of stay in the shelter; integrate trauma-informed care approaches; increase diversity of images by race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and gender identity; and increase the relevance of the audio-visual components. Conclusion(s): Youth and the health and social services providers who care for youth generally liked the core concepts and presentation of the curriculum. Using the ADAPT-ITT framework, minor, yet important, changes were made to increase the relevance, acceptability, and feasibility of the intervention. Next steps are to conduct a randomized attention control pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability.Copyright © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - COVID-19 had a psychological impact on the population, particularly those affected. Our objective was to investigate stress and resilience factors in the Senegalese soldiers affected during the first wave of COVID-19. Our retrospective and qualitative study included military personnel listed as contacts, suspects, or positive cases and supported by the Armed Forces Psychological Support Program during the period of isolation. The stress factors were health-related, sociological, and occupational. The conditions and the experience of isolation, stigmatization, and suspension of their professional projects were concerns for the soldiers. They had relied on personal, familial, and professional resources to cultivate resilience during the quarantine. Isolation during the pandemic showed psychological consequences, the foundations of which have been found in our study.Copyright © 2024, African Field Epidemiology Network. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: Burnout, resilience, and thriving significantly impact academics, particularly in health professions, where responsibilities are extensive. This study aimed to explore these constructs among academic health professionals, examining sociodemographic and work-related factors influencing these outcomes. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted among academic health professionals via web-based professional networks from August 2022 to February 2023. Validated tools were used, and descriptive and inferential statistics were applied. Result(s): 505 participants were included, predominantly female (63%), with a mean age of 38.15+/-9.6years. High burnout was reported by 10.9%, 13.7% experienced exhaustion, and 6.3% were disengaged. Resilience and thriving were moderate at 59.2 and 51.9%, respectively. Age correlated negatively with burnout (r=-0.131, p=0.003) but positively with resilience (r=0.178, p<0.001). Females reported higher exhaustion (p=0.014), while males showed greater resilience (p=0.016). Instructors exhibited lower resilience compared to assistant professors (p<0.001) and associate professors (p<0.001). Those at public universities reported higher exhaustion than those at private universities (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Variable levels of burnout, resilience, and thriving were observed among academic health professionals, influenced by sociodemographic and work-related factors. Interventions targeting resilience and thriving may mitigate burnout risk and enhance engagement among academics in health professions.Copyright © 2024 Nahas, Elnaem, Mubarak, Khatwa, Barakat, Faller, Kassem, Ramatillah, Jaber, Akkawi, Al-Shami, Chandran, Mohamed, Jack, Abouelhana, Courtenay and Elrggal.

N2  - PURPOSE: Nurse leaders are challenged by ethical issues in today's complex health-care settings. The purpose of this study was to describe and analyze key elements of moral distress identified by nurse leaders from health-care systems in the USA, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The aim was to develop an understanding of distressing ethical issues nurse leaders face in the USA and three German-speaking European countries. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This descriptive cross-sectional study surveyed a convenience sample of nurse leaders in the USA, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The voluntary, anonymous survey also included qualitative questions and was distributed using the Qualtrics platform. A thematic analysis of the qualitative data in each country was carried out and a comparative analysis identified similarities and differences between the groups of nurse leaders comparing the US data to that from three German-speaking European countries. FINDINGS: The survey was completed by 316 nurse leaders: Germany, Austria, and Switzerland (n = 225) and the USA (n = 91). Similar themes identified as causing all nurse leaders moral distress included a lack of individual and organizational integrity, hierarchical and interprofessional issues, lack of nursing professionalism, patient care/patient safety concerns, finances negatively impacting care and issues around social justice. Within these six themes, there were also differences between the USA and the three German-speaking European countries. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Understanding the experiences associated with distressing ethical situations can allow nurse leaders and organizations to focus on solutions and develop resilience to reduce moral distress in the USA and three German-speaking European countries.Copyright © Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Military gendarmes are frequently exposed to events with traumatic impact, with negative effects on emotional and physical health. The present research aims to analyse the effectiveness of Military Resilience Training (MRTR), a psychological intervention programme developed to reduce perceived stress, increase the perception of adaptive resources and strengthen resilience. Ninety-eight participants who met the inclusion criteria were enroled in a single-blind randomized controlled trial. The psychological training programme was implemented in the intervention group (n = 48) for a duration of 5 months. The participants in the control group (n = 50) were scheduled to start the training later. The levels of perceived stress, adaptive resources and resilience were measured in all participants, from the intervention and the control group, before and after the intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. The effects of the intervention (Cohen's d) were very high for adaptive resources (d = 0.99), self-schemes (d = 1.33), family support (d = 0.70), and partner support (d = 0.66), average for resilience (d = 0.53) and stress (d = 0.49), with very high effects on military task demands (d = 1.19) and averages for friction with authority (d = 0.51). The effects were obtained only in the intervention group, and all gains were maintained at follow-up. This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of MRTR, a psychological intervention implemented in the military gendarmerie population. In the short and long term, MRTR has significant effects in reducing perceived stress, increasing the perception of adaptive resources and strengthening the resilience of military gendarmes.Copyright © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a social, economic and health crisis that had a major impact on the mental health of the global community, particularly nurses. The objective of the current study is to conduct a longitudinal evaluation of the trajectory of depressive, anxiety, trauma, and fear of COVID-19 symptoms, comparing self-reports of nurses and the general population over a six-month period. Self-report questionnaires were administered online to a sample of 180 nurses and 158 individuals from the general population for the baseline assessment (T1) and follow-up at 6 months (T2). Levels of symptoms reported by nurses were generally greater and tended to worsen over time, as opposed to the levels of symptoms reported by the general population that tended to improve. Levels of depressive, anxiety, and trauma symptoms were significantly different between nurses and the general population over time. Levels of fear of COVID-19 declined significantly from T1 to T2 in both groups. These results suggest that it is crucial to monitor the longer-term effects of COVID-19 and to develop resilience-promoting interventions tailored to the unique needs of this vulnerable group.Copyright: © 2024 Vitorino et al.

N2  - Background: Physician burnout has reached epidemic proportions. Although burnout is rooted in systems, practices for physician wellbeing and community can address exhaustion, burnout, and isolation. Inspired by the Japanese practice shinrin-yoku, forest therapy/bathing (FT) is a nature immersion practice that improves wellbeing in a group setting. Objective(s): This program offered guided FT experiences to frontline faculty physicians in the Department of Medicine and evaluated potential for impact on burnout, resilience, and community. Method(s): Faculty physicians were recruited via email invitations to a free Forest Therapy group experience in the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, MA. Participants completed pre-and post-course surveys and evaluated its value as a community experience. Surveys measured burnout, resilience, and qualitative feedback on the experience. Result(s): Twenty-seven faculty completed the baseline survey, twenty-three faculty participated, with 19 survey respondents. At baseline, 85% reported feeling burned out at least once a month. 46% reported feeling burned out more than a few times a month. 83% of participants responded that forest therapy could help them with the feeling of being burned out from work. Post-intervention, 100% of participants rated the experience as very or extremely valuable. 96% of participants reported they were interested in more frequent forest therapy sessions. 100% of participants would recommend this practice to other faculty. 70% of respondents reported the program could help them with burnout. Despite high baseline resilience, 94% of participants reported that forest therapy could help with stressful events and setbacks. Post-intervention, participants reported feeling relaxed, at peace, and calm. Conclusion(s): This pilot demonstrates feasibility and acceptability for physicians of FT. Participants would consider recommending FT to their colleagues, and agreed that FT can help with wellbeing, and expressed enthusiasm for the community experience. This program may also be successfully incorporated into programs for leadership, teambuilding, and support after adverse events.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - Introduction: Organ Donation Coordinators (OTDCs) play a fundamental role in deceased organ donation processes. However, due to the emotionally challenging and stressful scenarios faced daily, they are commonly affected by work-related issues (e.g., burnout and compassion fatigue), which can lead to increased turnover, reduced quality of healthcare services and negative impact in Organ Donation Organizations performance. Therefore, Canadian Blood Services has partnered with CHEO Research Institute and the organ and tissue donation community to create a research program to study Burnout and Resilience in OTDCs (The BRiC Research Program). The main objectives of the BRiC Research Program are to investigate the incidence and potential causes of work-related issues among OTDCs and to propose innovative ways of dealing with these issues to support teams and decrease turnover of experienced and exceptional OTDCs. Method(s): The BRiC Research Program was built using a participatory approach that provides the best evidence possible to help address the specific needs of knowledge users (Organ Donation Organizations and OTDCs). The BRiC started with the development of a core three-phased study: phase 1, we published a scoping review to investigate the available literature on burnout and compassion fatigue among OTDCs; in phase 2, we are using a mixed-methods approach to explore work-related issues among Canadian OTDCs; and in phase 3, informed by phases 1 and 2, we will develop, implement and measurethe impact of interventions designed to address workrelated issues among OTDCs. In addition to the core three-phased study, we also completedfour related projects: (1) a working meeting with representatives from Canadian Organ Donation Organizations; (2) a reflective narrative paper co-authored by Canadian OTDCs discussing their views and experiences with work-related issues; (3) a qualitative study that investigated experiences of OTDCs about compassion fatigue, burnout and resilience; and (4) a qualitative study that explored the perceptions of OTDCs related to their experiences in a Relationship Centred Care workshop. Result(s): An overview of the BRiC Research Program can be found in Figure 1. The outputs of this research program since its launching in 2019 include: a scoping review protocol and a final manuscript publication; three publications regarding the additional projects (reflective narrative, and results from both qualitative studies); 2 poster presentations, 4 invited speaker presentations; and 9 grant applications, 2 granted. Conclusion(s): The findings from this research program will inform clinical practice through knowledge dissemination activities. As this study has been designed in collaboration with national knowledge disseminators (Canadian Blood Services) and provincial end users (Organ Donation Organizations) it will yield meaningful results that can be readily integrated into strategies to decrease OTDC turnover.

N2  - Introduction. The Health District (HD) is a critical component of Italy's National Health Service, responsible for ensuring Primary Health Care (PHC) services in response to community health needs. The Italian government established a national strategic reform program, the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), starting in 2022, with a series of health interventions to reorganize the PHC setting, the main reform being the Ministerial Decree 77/2022 (DM77). Our study aimed to provide a description of socio-demographic data and to assess the correlation between HDs, in order to suggest health intervention priorities in PHC reforms. Materials and methods. We conducted our analysis using a cross-sectional record linkage of data from multiple sources to compare organizational and socio-demographic variables. A dataset was created with each of the 21 Italian Regions' HDs data of population, land area, mean age, ageing index, old-age dependency ratio, birth rate and death rate. The Inland Areas Project data was integrated for a socio-economic perspective. Results. Our study identified comparable groups of HDs, considering demographical, socio-economic and geographical aspects. The study provides a baseline understanding of the Italian situation prior to the implementation of DM77. It also highlights that inhabitants number cannot be the only variable to take into account for the definition of Italian HDs organisation and PHC reform, providing intercorrelated variables that take into account geographic location, demographic data, and socio-economic aspects. Conclusion. By acknowledging the interplay of demographic, socio-economic, and geographic factors, policymakers can tailor interventions to address diverse community needs, ensuring a more effective and equitable PHC system.© Copyright by Pacini Editore Srl, Pisa, Italy.

N2  - Incarceration is one of the most stressful life experiences with negative impacts on the health and wellbeing of the prisoners. Sufficient studies exist on the association between religiosity and adjustment to prison (ATP) but no studies have investigated the mediating variables explaining this link. This study examined the mediating role of resilience on the relationship between religiosity and ATP. Participants 513 inmates (males=410, females=103; mean age=30.86, SD=7.71years) drawn from Enugu and Nsukka custodial centres in the South East Nigeria. They responded to Prison Adjustment Questionnaire, Religious Orientation Test and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale in addition to supplying other relevant information. Hayes PROCESS macro for SPSS which uses a regression-based, path-analytical framework, was used in the data analysis. The results showed a significant indirect effect of resilience on the association between religiosity and ATP (beta=.45, p<.001, 95% CI [0.27, 0.62]). This result revealed that resilience mediated the relationship between religiosity and ATP, indicating that individuals who are religious may possess higher resilience, leading to improved ATP. In conclusion, the study recommends incorporating comprehensive mental health services with a focus on resilience-building strategies in prison policies. Encouraging detainees' religious beliefs and activities is suggested, along with promoting psychological therapies to enhance resilience and improve adjustment to prison life.

The mediating effects of resilience and nurse-patient relationship were explored. BACKGROUND: Professional identity of nursing students can influence their pursuit of a nursing career. Negative mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and high stress, are known risk factors for professional identity. Few studies have examined the association of professional identity with positive mental well-being and underlying mechanisms. METHOD(S): This was a cross-sectional study of Chinese nursing students on clinical placement. The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale, Professional Identity Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Nurse-Patient Relationship Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire were used, and demographic and study-related characteristics were measured. Multivariable linear regression and mediation analyses analyzed the associations. We followed the STROBE reporting guidelines. RESULT(S): Of 208 participants, the total scores of positive mental well-being and professional identity were at a moderate level. Positive mental well-being was associated with professional identity after adjusting for confounders including the main reason for choosing nursing and negative mental health. Resilience was a full mediator of the association between positive mental well-being and professional identity, whereas nurse-patient relationship was a partial mediator. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION(S): Positive mental well-being was associated with professional identity in Chinese nursing students on clinical placement, mediated through resilience and nurse-patient relationship. Positive mental well-being can be a facilitator for the professional identity of nursing students, and resilience and nurse-patient relationship could be potential mechanisms for nurse professional development. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND/OR HEALTH POLICY: Nurse researchers, educators, and policymakers are informed to increase the awareness of positive mental well-being and develop interventions targeting resilience and nurse-patient relationship for building a stable and satisfied nursing team.Copyright © 2024 International Council of Nurses.

N2  - Background: Firefighters are an at-risk population for multiple psychiatric conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, alcohol use disorders (AUDs), and insomnia. These disorders are likely to co-occur; however, patterns of comorbidity have scarcely been investigated in firefighters. We aimed to identify subgroups of comorbidity of PTSD, depression, AUDs, and insomnia in a nationwide population of firefighters in South Korea. Method(s): A total of 54,054 firefighters responded to an online survey. Latent classes of comorbidity were categorized using latent profile analysis (LPA) based on the symptom scores of PTSD, depression, AUDs, and insomnia. Analysis of variance was performed to compare the characteristics of the identified classes, and multinomial logistic regression was conducted to examine whether anger reactions, resilience, and number of traumatic events predicted class membership. Result(s): The LPA identified four subgroups: minimal symptoms (n = 42,948, 79.5 %), predominant PTSD (n = 2858, 5.3 %), subthreshold symptoms and comorbidity (n = 7003, 13.0 %), and high symptoms and comorbidity (n = 1245, 2.3 %). Three comorbidity classes were defined based on severity and one class showed predominant PTSD symptoms. Number of traumatic exposures predicted predominant PTSD, while resilience and anger reactions predicted severity of comorbidities. Limitation(s): The cross-sectional design and usage of self-reported questionnaires are limitations of this study. Conclusion(s): The severity of PTSD, depression, AUDs and insomnia tend to correlate and co-occur in firefighters. Our findings highlight the need to assess comorbid symptoms in firefighters and need to reduce anger reactions and enhance resilience in those with multiple comorbidities.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Aims We aimed to recruit a representative cohort of women and men with multi-morbid chronic heart disease as part of a trial testing an innovative, nurse-co-ordinated, multi-faceted intervention to lower rehospitalization and death by addressing areas of vulnerability to external challenges to their health. Methods The prospective, randomized open, blinded end-point RESILIENCE Trial recruited 203 hospital inpatients (mean age 75.7 +/- and results 10.2 years) of whom 51% were women and 94% had combined coronary artery disease, heart failure, and/or atrial fibrillation. Levels of concurrent multi-morbidity were high (mean Charlson Index of Comorbidity Score 6.5 +/- 2.7), and 8.9% had at least mild frailty according to the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale. Including the index admission, 19-20% of women and men had a pre-existing pattern of seasonally linked hospitalization (seasonality). Detailed phenotyping revealed that 48% of women and 40% of men had >=3 physiological factors, and 15% of women and 16% of men had >=3 behavioural factors likely to increase their vulnerability to external provocations to their health. Overall, 61-62% of women and men had >=4 combined factors indicative of such vulnerability. Additional factors such as reliance on the public health system (63 vs. 49%), lower education (30 vs. 14%), and living alone (48 vs. 29%) were more prevalent in women. Conclusion We successfully recruited women and men with multi-morbid chronic heart disease and bio-behavioural indicators of vulnerability to external provocations to their health. Once completed, the RESILIENCE TRIAL will provide important insights on the impact of addressing such vulnerability (promoting resilience) on subsequent health outcomes.

N2  - Background: Chronic diseases are a significant burden on the healthcare system. Nutrition counseling plays a pivotal role in the management and prevention of chronic diseases. Despite its importance, primary healthcare clinicians face practical challenges in providing effective nutritional guidance owing to time limitations, lack of information, and resistance of patients. Current Concepts: This review identifies the main barriers to nutrition counseling that are encountered by primary healthcare clinicians. We propose general strategies to overcome these obstacles, emphasizing the need for simple and easy approaches in clinical settings. In addition, specific one-point counseling methods according to gender and age that can be applied in various situations, techniques related to behavior change for motivating and guiding patients, and practical tips to cope with common conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity are also discussed. Additionally, utilization of education materials, apps, and websites as convenient resources for patients is highlighted. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Real-life cases demonstrated successful application of nutrition counseling in clinical practice that benefitted both the patients and clinicians. This review suggests enhancing nutrition education in medical schools and residency programs, along with activating nutrition counseling fees to motivate and support clinicians. In conclusion, this review reaffirms the importance of nutrition counseling and stresses the need for continuous learning and practice by clinicians. In the future, nutrition counseling is envisioned as a more integrated and patient-centered approach, necessitating active engagement and adaptation by primary healthcare providers.Copyright © 2024 Korean Medical Association.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced breast cancer require consistent help and support from family caregivers. These caregivers often endure financial burdens and psychological stress, with their experiences significantly influenced by sociocultural factors. This study aims to explore the experiences of family caregivers of advanced breast cancer patients in Punjab province, Pakistan. METHOD(S): Data was collected through in-depth interviews with fifteen family caregivers of advanced breast cancer patients in three major cities of Punjab, Pakistan. Caregivers, who had been in close contact with the patient for the last two years, were purposively sampled from five major hospitals. The data was analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULT(S): The study revealed that the experiences of family caregivers are deeply rooted in the sociocultural context. Key themes identified include social responsibility and cultural reciprocity norms; limited awareness and mobility options for caregivers; financial responsibility and strain; impacts of beauty myths and shyness on caregiving attitudes and decisions; the stressful and emotional nature of caregiving; treatment perspectives influenced by social groups; challenges in consulting male physicians and associated stigma; the role of religious beliefs in caregiving; and stress management, with religion often being a coping mechanism. These factors can contribute to delayed treatment decisions for patients. CONCLUSION(S): Family caregivers are crucial in facilitating timely treatment decisions for advanced breast cancer patients in the Pakistani context. To minimize treatment delays and alleviate caregiver stress, addressing sociocultural barriers in care-seeking is essential. A tailored approach, considering sociocultural and religious factors, is imperative for the management and early diagnosis of breast cancer, necessitating appropriate policymaking and implementation.Copyright © 2024.

N2  - Face-to-face 'Pet Bereavement Counselling' (PBC) has been established in private practice to support bereaved animal companion owners, however, to date no research has been conducted on PBC. This study aimed to contribute to the existing knowledge base on animal companion loss and provide a preliminary research base on the potential salience of PBC. Six qualified and accredited PBC therapists were recruited and took part in semi-structured interviews. An inductive thematic analysis revealed participants' perspectives on the acknowledgement of animal companion loss societally and within counselling professions, the diverse ways animal companion loss can impact on bereaved owners, as well as the distinctive attributes and delivery of PBC. The findings have implications for how animal companion loss is conceptualised within counselling professions, teaching and research. Future research recommendations include exploring how bereaved owners experience PBC and how mental health professionals can build upon the support provided to bereaved owners.

T1  - The child psychiatrist's role with respect to the neglected child
T3  - Place du pedopsychiatre aupres de l'enfant neglige
A1  - Guivarch J. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. It can also have the most serious impact on a child's development, with an increased and accompanying risk of the emergence of psychiatric disorders from adolescence to adulthood. Child neglect is under-recognized today, due to a lack of training for professionals, the orientation of child psychiatry, and difficulties in understanding what this vague concept refers to. After proposing definitions of neglect, its characteristics, and its effects, we present the possible actions of the child psychiatrist in the ecosystem of the neglected child. Neglect is neither a legal nor a medical term. It is, however, used by doctors and social workers, with a loose definition as the absence of appropriate care for a child's development. Neglect is multifactorial. The French consensus approach to the basic needs of the child has highlighted a meta-need for security, emphasizing attachment and the particular qualities of the caregiver. In light of this report, we understand that affective or emotional neglect is the most problematic form of neglect. The effects of neglect are early, depending on the child's age. They can manifest as developmental delays, sleep disorders, tonus disorders in infants, intellectual disorders, and various internalized and externalized disorders in adolescence. Mortality and morbidity are increased in cases of neglect, and developmental sequelae have been described. Neglect has a greater impact on development than physical abuse. The child psychiatrist can take three types of action to treat the neglected child. Firstly, he or she must identify neglect and alert the appropriate instances so as to protect the child. Identification involves being aware of indicators of neglect and a particular clinical pattern that varies according to age, requiring the exploration of the different lines of development. Three clinical patterns seem to be linked to extreme neglect: anaclitic depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly complex developmental trauma, and attachment disorders. When faced with symptoms suggestive of neglect, the child psychiatrist should try to rule out a sensory or neurodevelopmental cause, sometimes seeking the advice of a specialist. He or she will observe the child's behavior alone and with his or her parents, as well as parent-child relationships, and will consider the child outside the family microsystem in an ecosystemic approach. The child psychiatrist can use available standardized tools that explore the various dimensions of neglect. This multi-consultation assessment should not delay the child psychiatrist's initial actions, given the narrow developmental windows. In particular, the child psychiatrist may be required to report the child's situation to the administrative and judicial authorities. The care provided to the neglected child will then take place within the child's own ecosystem. Interventions must be early, participative and in partnership with social services, educators, and staff at the placement site. Care will seek to compensate for the negative developmental effects of neglect, in order to correct the child's developmental trajectory. It must take into account the child's psychopathology. Psychotherapy, the framework of which will need to be adapted, will help the child to assume ownership of his or her history. Child psychiatrists can also take part in innovative initiatives to help children at risk, such as mobile teams. The final action to be developed by the trained child psychiatrist is preventative. It is important that child psychiatrists be informed and trained to deal with neglect and its effects. Today's neglected children will be tomorrow's adults with the most psychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore and analyze the correlation between anxiety levels, coping strategies, and fertility quality of life in male soldiers with infertility. METHOD(S): A questionnaire survey was conducted on 480 male soldiers with infertility who visited the Reproductive Medicine Department of the Eastern Theater Command General Hospital from June 2022 to February 2023, analyze the impact of anxiety levels on stress coping strategies and fertility quality of life in male officers and soldiers with infertility. RESULT(S): Self evaluation scale score is (43.06 +/- 15.02), Fertility Quality of Life Scale score is (52.11 +/- 36.68), Trait Coping Style Questionnaire score is (48.45 +/- 23.15). The relevant analysis results show that there is a negative correlation between the scores of the Self Rating Anxiety Scale and the Reproductive Quality of Life Scale, a positive correlation between the scores of the Self Rating Anxiety Scale and the Trait Coping Style Questionnaire, and a positive correlation between the scores of the Reproductive Quality of Life Scale and the Trait Coping Style Questionnaire. The results of multiple regression analysis showed that years of infertility, history of childbirth, anxiety level, and coping strategies entered the regression equation. The anxiety level of male officers and soldiers with infertility has a mediating effect on the relationship between stress coping styles and quality of life during childbirth. CONCLUSION(S): The mental health status of male officers and soldiers with infertility is poor, and their coping strategies and quality of life during childbirth are at a moderate to low level. This indicates that more attention should be paid to the special group of male officers and soldiers with infertility, and psychological intervention should be strengthened in routine treatment. Provide support from different perspectives to address concerns and enhance the combat effectiveness of the military.

N2  - Background: The diagnosis of a brain tumor is a catastrophic life changing event that impacts the entire family. Patients and caregivers experience dramatic role changes, concern for their children, financial stress, and isolation. For many, the situation is overwhelming. A novel intervention to address these needs is "Family Camp". Our vision for camp was to provide respite to the entire family, decrease caregiver stress, improve family connections and promote a sense of understanding and connection with the community at large. Method(s): In a unique partnership with the widow of a former patient, the members of the UCSF Neuro-Oncology Division created and offered a weekend camp for brain tumor patients with children. Team members included MDs, RNs, social workers, psychologists, artists, body workers, "camp counselors" and community volunteers. In addition to respite, camp was structured through art, songs, projects and games to deliver opportunities for understanding and community building, including understanding the disease and its impact on the family. Therapeutic interventions included couples activities, counseling, parenting strategies, and providing a sense of connection to others dealing with brain tumors, the health care team, and camp volunteers. Anxiety, stress, depression, coping and values based living were measured pre and post camp using DASS21, CES-D, Brief Cope, Values Based Living instruments, and survey questions. Result(s): 11 families attended camp for 3 days in 2014. Improvement was noted in post camp testing of depression, anxiety and stress versus pre-camp. Survey questions showed the most common and important outcome to be connection, specifically that patients, caregivers, and children made connections with similar others. Families reported being able to relax and felt taken care of. They liked the opportunity for undistracted family time, getting to know their health providers outside of the office, and couples benefited from family counseling. Conclusion(s):Capitalizing on the unique skills of a multi-disciplinary team, one that includes the patient's health care team, can lead to the delivery of a novel intervention that improves the illness experience of brain tumor patients and families.

N2  - Background: Although there are effective psychological treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), they remain inaccessible for many people. Digitally enabled therapy is a way to overcome this problem; however, there is little evidence on which forms of these therapies are most cost effective in PTSD. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the STOP-PTSD trial, which evaluated two therapist-assisted, internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapies: cognitive therapy for PTSD (iCT-PTSD) and a programme focusing on stress management (iStress-PTSD). Method(s): In this health economic evaluation, we used data from the STOP-PTSD trial (n=217), a single-blind, randomised controlled trial, to compare iCT-PTSD and iStress-PTSD in terms of resource use and health outcomes. In the trial, participants (aged >=18 years) who met DSM-5 criteria for PTSD were recruited from primary care therapy services in South East England. The interventions were delivered online with therapist support for the first 12 weeks, and three telephone calls over the next 3 months. Participants completed questionnaires on symptoms, wellbeing, quality of life, and resource use at baseline, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, and 39 weeks after randomisation. We used a cost-effectiveness analysis to assess cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) at 39 weeks post-randomisation, from the perspective of the English National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services and on the basis of intention-to-treat for complete cases. Treatment modules and the platform design were developed with extensive input from service users: service users also advised on the trial protocol and methods, including the health economic measures. This is a pre-planned analysis of the STOP-PTSD trial; the trial was registered prospectively on the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN16806208). Finding(s): NHS costs were similar across treatment groups, but clinical outcomes were superior for iCT-PTSD compared with iStress-PTSD. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for NHS costs and personal social services was estimated as 1921 per QALY. iCT-PTSD had an estimated 91.6% chance of being cost effective at the 20 000 per QALY threshold. From the societal perspective, iCT-PTSD was cost saving compared with iStress-PTSD. Interpretation(s): iCT-PTSD is a cost-effective form of therapist-assisted, internet-delivered psychological therapy relative to iStress-PTSD, and it could be considered for clinical implementation.

N2  - Background: Informal caregivers are an essential health resource in the care of persons with severe mental disorders, particularly in South Africa where access to mental healthcare services is limited. Aim(s): The study aimed to explore and describe the coping strategies used by informal caregivers and the specific health impacts they face in the context of severe mental disorders in South Africa. Setting(s): The study was conducted in Bushbuckridge municipality situated in the northeastern parts of Mpumalanga province, South Africa. Method(s): A descriptive qualitative methodology was used to conduct semi-structured interviews with 12 purposefully selected participants. Audio-recorded interviews were translated, transcribed and analysed inductively on NVivo12 using reflexive thematic analysis. Result(s): The themes identified were caregivers' experience of consequences of caregiving and caregivers' experience of coping with their caregiving role. Participants experienced negative consequences on their emotional, mental and physical health. The participants use internal and external resources to cope with the challenges they face, and many highlighted using emotion-focused coping strategies. Conclusion(s): The findings revealed an urgent need to develop support strategies to strengthen informal caregivers' coping and promote good health particularly in rural South Africa where informal caregivers play a crucial role in the management of severe mental disorders. Contribution: The finding demands that policymakers and healthcare providers prioritise the health and well-being of the informal caregivers. There should be policies targeted specifically at developing and implementing caregiver-orientated healthcare services.Copyright © 2024. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.

N2  - Background: Leveraging military veterans' intimate relationships during treatment has the potential to concurrently improve posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and relationship quality. Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) and an 8-session Brief Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (bCBCT) are manualized treatments designed to simultaneously improve PTSD and relationship functioning for couples in which one partner has PTSD. Although efficacious in improving PTSD, the effects of CBCT on relationship satisfaction are small, especially among veterans. Intranasal oxytocin, which targets mechanisms of PTSD and relationship quality, may enhance the efficacy of bCBCT. Method/design: The purpose of this 4-year clinical trial is to compare the outcomes of bCBCT augmented with intranasal oxytocin versus bCBCT plus placebo. We will also explore potential mechanisms of action: self-reported communication skills, empathy, and trust. We will recruit 120 dyads (i.e., veteran with PTSD and their intimate partner) from the VA San Diego Healthcare System. Veterans will be administered 40 international units of oxytocin (n = 60) or placebo (n = 60) 30 min before each of 8 bCBCT sessions delivered via telehealth. Clinical and functioning outcomes will be assessed at five timepoints (baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up). Conclusion(s): Study findings will reveal the efficacy of oxytocin-assisted brief couple therapy for PTSD, which could serve as highly scalable option for couples coping with PTSD, as well as provide preliminary evidence of interpersonal mechanisms of change.

N2  - Outcomes: 1. Participants will be able to understand that a quality improvement model is an effective method for developing graduate medical education curricula for end-of-life care. 2. Participants will be able to recognize the lack of pediatric resident physician education in end-of-life care. Key Message: This quality improvement project aimed at improving pediatric resident physicians' comfort and competency in providing end-of-life care. A curriculum, including lectures on post-patient death tasks was created and implemented. Pre- and post-lecture surveys showed significant improvement in resident comfort levels, highlighting the effectiveness of lectures in teaching end-of-life care. Continued assessment after future topics and interventions will optimize education Background: Inspired by personal experiences of the resident physician authors, counseling a dying patient and their family as well as providing end-of-life (EOL) care can often be a clinically and emotionally challenging experience for providers. Resident physicians are frequently the frontline providers when a pediatric patient is receiving EOL care in the inpatient setting. However, pediatric resident physicians often report low comfortability with providing EOL services [1]. Objective(s): To create and implement an EOL curriculum for pediatric resident physicians to use in their training and future careers. Setting/Participants: Categorical pediatrics residents at a tertiary care children's hospital were exposed to the curriculum. Method(s): This study was a quality improvement project with multiple PDSA cycles. A lecture was designed and implemented by resident physicians and a pediatric palliative care specialist. The topics addressed included immediate actions following a patient's death and symptom management of actively dying patients. A cross-sectional survey was administered pre- and post-implementation to assess comfortability with providing end-of-life care and future directions for the curriculum. Result(s): Twenty-seven residents completed the pre-lecture survey, and 13 residents completed the post-lecture survey. Two sample t-testing revealed a significant difference in the responses to repeated competency question (P=4.81E-8). Quality resident responses identified perceived deficiencies, including symptom management, discussing death, the pathophysiology of death, and resident coping skills following the death of a patient. Conclusions/Future Direction: In the first cycle of this quality improvement project, residents participated in a lecture regarding the tasks to complete after a patient dies in the hospital. Resident comfort with this competency significantly improved following the lecture, suggesting that lectures can be an effective way to teach end-of-life care. These responses help to inform the next cycle of this project. Keywords: Quality ImprovementCopyright © 2024

N2  - Outcomes: 1. Utilizing a case-based and interactive approach, participants will self-report greater confidence in discussing a potential wean of HHFNC with patients and families. 2. Utilizing a case-based and interactive approach, participants will self-report greater confidence in eliciting and exploring existential, cultural, and religious concerns in patients considering a palliative oxygen wean from maximum HHFNC. Key Message: This presentation addresses the holistic, multidisciplinary management of existential distress as well as religious and cultural considerations when counseling patients who are unable to wean from heated high flow nasal cannula (HHFNC). These vulnerable patients have highly specialized needs in end-of-life discussions since they are often awake and alert with minimal symptoms and must consider sedation to tolerate oxygen weaning. Introduction/Context: Heated high flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) is a lifesaving technology that allows patients to receive positive pressure ventilation and a high level of oxygen support while still being able to eat, talk, and participate in activities like physical therapy. This life support device can support patients who hope their lungs can heal while avoiding the adverse effects associated with mechanical ventilation. However, some patients don't recover enough lung function to wean from HHFNC and are thus unable to leave an acute care setting. Healthcare providers must discuss treatment options with these patients, including the option to elect for compassionate withdrawal of oxygen support. To tolerate weaning from maximum oxygen support, patients usually require palliative sedation because of the high burden of anxiety and dyspnea with this procedure. This presentation will address the distress that this conversation can cause in patients and their healthcare providers, and how we effectively utilize palliative care multidisciplinary teams to address existential distress, cultural and religious concerns, and thus create culturally competent patient-centered care with the available resources. Method(s): The authors review and contrast two patient cases in which the withdrawal of HHFNC is discussed. Result(s): After discussing withdrawal of HHFNC, both patients subsequently grappled with the idea of picking a date and time to transition from being fully awake and alert to undergoing palliative sedation. The patients' main concerns were about how to know when it is time to stop a life support treatment, whether stopping life support would be "acting against God's plan," and how to be sure their families were also spiritually supported. Palliative care chaplain and social work support helped with patient and family concerns. Conclusion(s): The palliative care multidisciplinary team is instrumental in helping patients and families cope with discussions about weaning HHFNC and the resultant existential and spiritual distress.

N2  - Outcomes: 1. Gain familiarity with generative artificial intelligence and its applications to mental health. 2. Learn how to conduct empirical research in palliative care focused on the opinions of children's mental health professionals regarding artificial intelligence. Key Message: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a tool in healthcare, with the potential to support grief counseling and legacy-building in families. The authors discuss new research on the intersection of AI with legacy-building among terminally ill parents for their children, and mental health experts' opinions about AI for children. Importance: With the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI), opportunities exist to help terminally ill parents co-create legacies for children. However, the impact of such practices on children's well-being is unknown. Objective(s): Assess children's mental health professionals' (CMHPs) opinions about psychological needs surrounding, and applications of AI for, children's coping with the loss of a parent. Scientific Methods Utilized: Practicing CMHPs were approached via association listservs and targeted social media ads. Data from N=298 (69% male, 72% white, 26% Latine, 56% rural/underserved communities; 87% of study total) physicians, psychologists, social workers, hospital chaplains, and community health workers were analyzed. Result(s): Among CMHPs, 54% engaged with families upon diagnosis of parental terminal illness, 34% believed anticipatory guidance about loss could begin at diagnosis, and 26% following parental death. Across 10 dimensions of childhood, Plackett-Luce Model rank-ordering revealed that: 1) children's premorbid exposure to traumatic events, 2) surviving caregiver presence, and 3) child age were important factors to consider in CMHP treatment decision-making. Regarding AI, 91% were frequent AI users (e.g., smart speakers) and 87% foresaw a role for generative AI (e.g., new audio, images, text, and videos based on someone's likeness) in supporting children's mental health. Opinions toward AI as a legacy-building tool varied: 47% denied its potential, 18% believed it could be introduced at parents' diagnosis, and 20% during treatment. In an adjusted multivariable model of the timing of generative AI introduction, CMHPs who believed anticipatory guidance could be introduced earlier in terminal illness believed AI could also be introduced earlier (B=.39, SE=.06, t=6.3, p<.01). Conclusion(s): AI may become a legacy-building tool for terminally ill parents to support children prior to and following loss. Impact: Research should explore the scope and impact that AI-generated content could have on children's mental health, grief, and long-term recovery.Copyright © 2024

N2  - Outcomes: 1. Appreciate the role of pilot studies in health services research. 2. Understand what are feasibility outcomes relevant for pilot studies. Key Message: The main objective was to pilot the culturally-adapted 'Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life Ends' for Singapore (ENABLE-SG) model to evaluate its feasibility and potential effectiveness. Based on findings from this study, we are planning a randomized waitlist-controlled trial of ENABLE-SG for patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers. Importance: Although ENABLE has demonstrated effectiveness in the U.S., we do not know whether or not ENABLE would be effective when implemented in contexts that have different organizational, social, and cultural norms. Objective(s): The main objective was to pilot the culturally-adapted 'Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life Ends' for Singapore (ENABLE-SG) model to evaluate its feasibility and potential effectiveness. Scientific Methods Utilized: A single arm pilot trial of ENABLE-SG among patients with advanced solid tumors and caregivers of these patients was conducted in the outpatient oncology clinic setting. Enrolled participants participated in individual ENABLE-SG psycho-educational sessions weekly. Patients had 6 sessions on the topics of maintaining positivity, self-care, coping with stress, managing symptoms, exploring what matters most and life review. Caregivers had 4 sessions on the topics of maintaining positivity, self-care, coping with stress and managing symptoms. At baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months after enrolment, patient's quality of life was measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Palliative Care (FACIT-Pal), patient's mood was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression scale (CES-D), and caregiver quality of life was measured using the Singapore Caregiver Quality of Life Scale (SCQOLS). Result(s): We enrolled 43 patients and 15 caregivers over a 10-month period from August 2021 to June 2022. Although there was a low approach-to-participation rate, most of those who enrolled completed all ENABLE-SG sessions - 72% for patients and 94% for caregivers. Caregivers had better quality of life over time, specifically in the subscales of mental well-being and experience-meaning. Conclusion(s): Except for the low approach-to-participation rate, this pilot study showed that the ENABLE-SG intervention was feasible with 72% of patients and 94% of caregivers completing all ENABLE-SG sessions. There was also some indication of benefit in quality of life for caregivers. Impact: Based on findings from this study, we are planning a randomized waitlist-controlled trial of ENABLE-SG for patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers.Copyright © 2024

N2  - Outcomes: 1. Along with understanding sources for rising cancer prevalence among Veterans of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander heritage, participants will be able to identify strategies to address geographic, logistical, and financial challenges, as well as effects of historical trauma, that may be exacerbating cancer health disparities. 2. By using an indigenous framework to health, participants will learn to culturally adapt clinical practices to address mistrust and build a therapeutic relationship with Veterans of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander heritage. Key Message: Cancer health disparities experienced by Veterans who are Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NH/PI) can be related to socioeconomic disadvantages, exposures, and lifestyle. Disparities may be perpetuated by present-day geographic, logistic, and financial barriers, as well as historical trauma. VHA clinicians suggested strategies to culturally adapt care, and we can use an indigenous health framework to promote equitable cancer and palliative care. Introduction: Veterans of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NH/PI) heritage have a high risk of developing cancer and related complications which may be amplified by barriers to cancer and palliative care. Method(s): This ongoing study applies a mixed method, community-based participatory research approach to understanding healthcare needs of Veterans with cancer who are NH/PI. The study is guided by a community advisory board. Through snowball sampling and outreach, we targeted recruitment to ethnically diverse, multidisciplinary clinicians in a major Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical center in Northern California and ambulatory clinics in the US-affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI) between 3/2023-9/2023. Participants completed 45-minute semi-structured interviews to assess barriers and facilitators to cancer care and palliative care. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, de-identified, and deductively then inductively analyzed using rapid analysis matrices and dual coder review in Atlas.ti v23. Result(s): Participants included 15 physicians, nurses, social workers, and clinical psychologists specializing in primary care, palliative care, and oncology, self-identifying as White, Asian American, NH/PI, and Multiracial. Preliminary analyses demonstrate the following barriers to accessing cancer and palliative care: 1) geographic, logistical, and financial challenges arranging long distance travel over an ocean with a "patient [who] needs to fly" that may get "ill on the flight"; 2) problems managing pain due to stoicism, misinformation as "people are still very anxious about" opioids, and constraints among VHA specialty care clinicians in the USAPI, 3) broadband infrastructure limitations leading to poor telehealth access; and 4) trauma, mistrust, and "tension from how Hawai'i [and other islands were] acquired by the United States." Conclusion(s): VHA clinicians discussed systemic, cultural, and historical barriers to cancer and palliative care while highlighting Veteran resilience and the promise of telehealth. An indigenous framework for health can help culturally adapt clinical practice and promote access to equitable health services for Veterans of NH/PI heritage.

N2  - Introduction. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, Pakistan is ranked as the fifth-most vulnerable country to climate change. Most recently, during June-August 2022, heavy torrential rains coupled with riverine, urban, and flash flooding led to an unprecedented disaster in Pakistan. Around thirty-three million people were affected by the floods. More than 2 million houses were damaged, leaving approximately 8 million displaced and approximately 600,000 people in relief camps. Among those, 8.2 million women and 16 million children are the worst affected, with many requiring urgent medical and reproductive healthcare. To plan an efficient healthcare program and a climate-resilient health system, it is crucial to understand the issues that the affected people face during floods. Methodology. This rapid assessment included the population in the most severely affected districts across the four provinces of Pakistan. A mixed methods approach using qualitative and quantitative techniques was utilized. A total of 52 qualitative, in-depth interviews were conducted with community-level healthcare providers, national and provincial government departments, and development partners involved in relief activities. Using a structured questionnaire, the quantitative cross-sectional survey was conducted with a final sample of 422 women, married and unmarried (15-49 years old), residing in the relief camps in the flood-affected areas. The outcome variable of the survey was the access to sexual and reproductive health services faced by the women in the flood-affected districts. Data collection took place four months postfloods during Nov-Dec 2022, while the data analysis was conducted between Dec 2022 and Jan 2023. The quantitative data was analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 20, and qualitative data was analyzed using NVivo 12. Ethical consent was sought from all the participants. Ethical approval was also sought from the ethics committee of the Health Services Academy, Government of Pakistan. Results. The findings indicated that, overall, all the provinces were unprepared for a calamity of such a large magnitude. Access to services and health data reporting from the flood-affected areas was challenging mainly due to a shortage of trained health workforce because of the displacement of a large volume of the health workforce. Overall, equipment, medicines, supplies, and food were scarce. Women residing in the camps were markedly affected, and 84% (375) were not satisfied with the flood relief services provided to them. The floods impacted their monthly income as 30% (132) of respondents started depending on charity postfloods. Almost 77% (344) reported limited access to sexual and reproductive health services and had yet to receive sanitary, hygiene, and delivery kits, while 69% (107 out of 154) of girls stopped schooling postfloods. Almost 77% (112) of the married women reported having a child less than one year of age. Yet, only 30% (44 out of 144 currently married women) were using any form of family planning method - damage to the health facilities affected access to overall maternal care services. Conclusion. The findings concluded that there was no planning for sexual and reproductive health services in the flood-affected areas. Several barriers were identified. The government and development partners needed to prepare to cater to women's needs during the floods. The findings highlight the need for collaborative efforts between the government, civil society, and development partners to address the challenges faced in disaster management and strengthen disaster management capacity.

N2  - Objective: To explore responses from primary care physicians (PCPs) from an integrative physician (IP) consultation and recommended integrative oncology (IO) treatment program. Method(s): Chemotherapy-treated patients were referred by their oncology healthcare professional to an IP, a physician dually trained in complementary medicine and supportive cancer care. The consultation summary and patient-centered IO treatment program was then sent to the patient's PCP, with PCP-to-IP responses analyzed qualitatively using ATLAS.Ti software for systematic coding and content analysis. Trial Registration Number NCT01860365 published May 22, 2013. Result(s): Of the 597 IP consultations conducted, 470 (78.7%) summaries were sent to patients' PCPs, with only 69 (14.7%) PCP-to-IP responses returned. PCPs were more likely to respond if the patient was Hebrew-speaking (78.3% vs. 65.1%, P = 0.032). Systematic coding identified four predominant themes among PCP narratives: addressing the patient's medical condition and leading QoL-related concerns; patient-centered reflections; available resources providing support and promoting resilience; and PCP attitudes to the IO treatment program. Conclusion(s): PCP-IP communication can provide valuable insight into the patient's bio-psycho-social care, addressing the patient's health-belief model, emotional concerns, caregiver-related factors, preferences, and barriers to adherence to IO care. Practice implications: Healthcare services should consider promoting IP-PCP communication in order to facilitate better patient outcomes from an IO treatment program.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Objective The Stress Management and Resilience Training (SMART) program is an evidence-based intervention designed to build resilience in physicians in clinical practice. The objective of the current study was to assess the impact of the SMART program on academic physicians' levels of resilience, subjective happiness, stress, and anxiety, and specifically during the implementation of a new hospital-wide Health Information System (HIS). Methods A total of 40 physicians in a tertiary care academic hospital were randomized (allocation ratio 1:1) to either the SMART intervention or the control condition. The SMART intervention consisted of one mandatory two-hour in-person workshop and an optional 24-week online program, designed to support the materials delivered in the workshop. Outcome measures were assessed using validated scales administered online at baseline and at 3-months and 6-months follow-up. Results After adjusting for baseline levels of each outcome, no statistically significant intervention effect was observed for resilience, subjective happiness, stress or anxiety at 3-months or 6-months follow-up. However, physicians in the intervention group demonstrated improvements in resilience, stress and anxiety at follow-up that were within the range of clinically relevant differences. Conclusions The findings of this exploratory study provide modest support that the SMART intervention may be beneficial for proactively addressing physician wellness during the implementation of a new HIS and that larger randomized trials are warranted.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) offers the prospect of a safe and effective adjunct therapeutic modality to promote mental health and reduce distress from symptoms in palliative care patients. Common physiological and psychological symptoms experienced at the end of life may impact the person's participation in day-to-day activities that bring them meaning. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of VR interventions on occupational participation and distress from symptoms. OBJECTIVE(S): To describe the stimulus, results, and learnings from a single-site pilot study of virtual reality therapy in a specialist palliative care setting. METHOD(S): Participants engaged in a VR session lasting from 9 to 30 minutes related to coping with pain, inner peace and mindfulness, adventure, and bucket list. METHODS MEASURES: The pilot prospective quantitative observational cohort study was conducted from November 2021 through March 2022 using a pre-post VR intervention research design. Quantitative data was collected using patient-rated assessments and a wireless pulse oximeter. Occupational performance, satisfaction, and distress symptoms were measured using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure and the Palliative Care Outcomes Collaboration Symptom Assessment Scale (PCOC SAS). The intervention and study design adhered to international guidelines. RESULT(S): Ten participants engaged in the VR interventions. Data showed significantly improved occupational performance and satisfaction scores (p < .001), decreases in PCOC SAS distress from pain (p = .01), fatigue (p < .001), and heart rate (p = .018). No adverse side effects were observed. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Outcomes included an analysis of virtual reality's effectiveness to alleviate symptom burden and increase occupational participation for palliative care patients. Of specific interest to the research team was the application of virtual reality in a community-based and inpatient palliative care context to supplement allied health services and its feasibility of integration into standard palliative care. CONCLUSION(S): VR therapy showed positive improvements in the participants' occupational performance, satisfaction, and distress from pain and fatigue.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nursing well-being has become a heightened focus since the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses are leaving the profession early in their careers or retiring sooner than expected. Those who remain in the workforce report higher levels of burnout, anxiety, depression, and exhaustion. There is concern that there may be a shortage of at least half a million nurses by 2030. AIMS: This systematic review aimed to investigate the evidence of using a mental health promotion mHealth app to improve the mental health of hospital nurses. METHOD(S): A systematic search was conducted in CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MEDLINE with Full Text, Professional Development Collection, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Sociological Collection, PsycInfo, Embase, and PubMed with search dates of January 2012-November 15, 2022. The mHealth intervention needed to be asynchronously delivered through a smartphone with hospital nurse participants to be included in this review. RESULT(S): Of the 157 articles screened for this review, six were included. Primary outcome variables were anxiety, burnout, coping, depression, self-efficacy, stress, well-being, and work engagement. Intervention types included mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), stress inoculation therapy (SIT), psychoeducation, and stress management. Anxiety, depression, well-being, and burnout improved with MBIs; depression improved with CBT; and anxiety and active coping improved with SIT. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: This review demonstrated promising findings in using mHealth apps to improve the mental health of hospital nurses. However, more randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes may reveal which type of mHealth app and how much exposure to the intervention is more effective in improving specific mental health symptoms. Longitudinal follow-up is also recommended to study sustainability of the mental health improvements.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nurse job satisfaction is a critical area of study with far-reaching implications for healthcare organizations, patient care, and the retention of nursing staff. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the association of gratitude with job satisfaction among Chinese nurses and examine the potential mediating roles of resilience and stress in this relationship. METHOD(S): Two separate studies were conducted to examine our research hypotheses. In Study 1, a total of 460 nurses completed the questionnaire related to gratitude, resilience, stress, and job satisfaction. A validation study was conducted in Study 2, which consisted of 709 nurses who also completed the same measures of gratitude, resilience, and stress to ensure the repeatability of the Study 1 results. Furthermore, a different scale was used to measure nurses' job satisfaction. RESULT(S): The two studies consistently found that both resilience and stress mediated gratitude-job satisfaction independently among Chinese nurses. Furthermore, resilience was found to be a significantly stronger mediator than stress in the association of gratitude with job satisfaction. Finally, we found that gratitude predicted nurses' job satisfaction via the serial mediating effects of resilience and stress. CONCLUSION(S): These findings highlight the complex interplay between gratitude, resilience, stress, and job satisfaction by demonstrating that resilience and stress act as parallel and sequential mediators between nurses' gratitude and job satisfaction. The healthcare sector can improve nurses' job satisfaction by increasing gratitude, building resilience, and reducing feelings of stress. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Nurse managers have the potential to enhance job satisfaction among nurses by implementing measures that increase gratitude, build resilience, and reduce stress levels.Copyright © 2024 Sigma Theta Tau International.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate possible immune cytokine trends throughout a week-long surgical simulation mass-casualty training session in order to determine the effects of stress inoculation on the immune system. METHOD(S): Thirty-seven military medical students participated in a hyper-realistic surgical simulation training event conducted at Strategic Operations site in San Diego, California. Salivary samples were collected every morning of the stress training exercise for 4 consecutive days. Cortisol, along with a panel of 42 immune cytokines, was measured using multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays from Eve Technologies. The determined concentrations were averaged and plotted on a scatter plot, and then points were fit to a second-order polynomial trendline of best fit to measure. RESULT(S): The cytokines epidermal growth factor, growth-related oncogene-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1alpha, and platelet-derived growth factor-AA followed a noted pattern of cortisol decrease throughout the week. In addition, cytokines IL-27, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, IL-10, and IL-13 demonstrated a late peak, followed by a return to baseline at the conclusion of training. Finally, the cytokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 displayed a decline throughout the week followed by an increase on the last day of stress training. CONCLUSION(S): Altogether, these results help to identify important biomarkers that may help to improve long-term stress adaptation and prevent post-traumatic stress disorder following exposure to repeated stress.

N2  - Objectives: To investigate the latent class of psychological resilience in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and examine the factors influencing various latent types. Method(s): A cross-sectional survey design was used in this study. A total of 480 patients with RA were enrolled from two tertiary care institutions in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, between May and November 2023, using the convenience sample approach. The General Information Questionnaire, CD-RISC-10, SSRS, ASES-8, and BRAF-MDQ were used to analyze the latent classes of psychological resilience in the respondents, and the factors influencing the latent classes were explored using one-way analysis of variance, analysis of variance, and multi-categorical logistic regression analysis. Result(s): Overall, 423 valid questionnaires were returned, indicating an 88.13% effective return rate. A latent class analysis revealed that RA patients were divided into three classes of psychological resilience: low-level (20.3%), moderate-level (31.0%), and high-level (48.7%) psychological resilience. A multi-categorical logistic regression analysis found that social support, self-efficacy, weariness, age, work status, and somatic pain all significantly influenced psychological resilience in RA patients. Conclusion(s): Three classes of RA patients' psychological resilience were identified by this study, and these classes were strongly correlated with individual treatment components. It is crucial to take into account the psychological resiliency of female RA patients who do not have a job. In order to improve psychological resilience, healthcare staff should first increase their comprehension of treat-to-target. Furthermore, people with RA may become more psychologically resilient if they receive more social support.

N2  - Background Advancing techniques and efficacy of new drug therapies have changed the status of radiotherapy within the management of stage III lung cancer in recent years, increasing the demand for radical intent concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT). A good level of physical & psychological fitness is required to cope with the rigours of CCRT, this needs to be maintained to access subsequent immunotherapy or surgery and for realisation of potential survival outcomes. Pre-surgical 'prehabilitation' has proven to benefit both patient experience and service efficiencies and have been funded for some years. However, the roll out of the same support for cancer patients receiving other radical therapies has been slow and inconsistent in delivery. Aims Establishing a multidisciplinary habilitation clinic for radical lung radiotherapy patients will: * Optimise physical fitness, emotional wellbeing & manage side-effects, improving clinical & patient reported outcomes. * Improve accessibility by reducing inequalities and variations in health. * Promote cost-effective professional development. Method A 12-month part NHS funded pilot habilitation clinic was established in April 2023 at QEH Birmingham. Allied Health Professionals (AHP&apos;s) were recruited locally upon expression of interest and professional availability (Table 1). Individualised habilitation followed baseline assessment completed by AHP&apos;s as far in advance of CCRT start as possible. [Formula presented] Results 4-6xWeekly 45-minute sessions were acceptable to all patients in the joint AHP format. All patients finished radiotherapy, and continued support remotely, proceeding to immunotherapy (if originally planned) unless by patient choice. AHPs reported increased motivation, professional development and sense of collaborative working. Clinical and experiential metrics were recorded and will be presented in due course. Conclusion Whilst existing care was well provided by the Lung Specialist Radiographer, AHP care provides a depth of knowledge and increased contact time. This model is able to withstand future pressures of an expanding service and enhance patient and clinical outcomes. Disclosure No significant relationships.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Grit, resilience and a growth-mindset influence students' ability to positively adapt to the challenges of health professional training. However, it is unclear if interventions can improve these traits. This systematic review aimed to explore if interventions can improve these traits in health professional students (primary) and their impact on academic and/or wellbeing outcomes (secondary). METHOD(S): A comprehensive search of CINAHL, MEDLINE, Eric and Embase was conducted from inception until 15 March 2023. Randomised or non-randomised controlled trials and single-group intervention studies that aimed to improve health professional students' resilience, grit and/or growth-mindset were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion and evaluated quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Post-intervention data from randomised and non-randomised control trials were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULT(S): Resilience interventions improved resilience by a moderate amount in 13 studies with 990 participants (pooled SMD 0.74, 95%CI 0.03 to 1.46) and a large amount when interventions were greater than one session duration in 10 trials with 740 participants (pooled SMD 0.97, 95%CI 0.08 to 1.85). Grit and growth-mindset interventions improved grit (pooled SMD 0.48, 95%CI -0.05 to 1.00, n=2) and growth-mindset (pooled SMD 0.25, 95%CI -0.18 to 0.68, n=2) by a small amount. Resilience interventions decreased perceived stress by a small amount (pooled SMD -0.38, 95%CI -0.62 to -0.14, n=5). CONCLUSION(S): Resilience interventions improve resilience and decrease perceived stress in health professional students. Preliminary evidence suggests grit and growth-mindset interventions may also benefit health professional students. Interventions may be most effective when they are longer than one session and targeted to students with low baseline levels of resilience and grit.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

N2  - Background: Since 2020, Thailand has experienced four waves of COVID-19. By 31 January 2022, there were 2.4 million cumulative cases and 22,176 deaths nationwide. This study assessed the governance and policy responses adapted to different sizes of the pandemic outbreaks and other challenges. Method(s): A qualitative study was applied, including literature reviews and in-depth interviews with 17 multi-sectoral actors purposively identified from those who were responsible for pandemic control and vaccine rollout. We applied deductive approaches using health systems building blocks, and inductive approaches using analysis of in-depth interview content, where key content formed sub-themes, and different sub-themes formed the themes of the study. Finding(s): Three themes emerged from this study. First, the large scale of COVID-19 infections, especially the Delta strain in 2021, challenged the functioning of the health system's capacity to respond to cases and maintain essential health services. The Bangkok local government insufficiently performed due to its limited capacity, ineffective multi-sectoral collaboration, and high levels of vulnerability in the population. However, adequate financing, universal health coverage, and health workforce professionalism and commitment were key enabling factors that supported the health system. Second, the population's vulnerability exacerbated infection spread, and protracted political conflicts and political interference resulted in the politicization of pandemic control measures and vaccine roll-out; all were key barriers to effective pandemic control. Third, various innovations and adaptive capacities minimized the supply-side gaps, while social capital and civil society engagement boosted community resilience. Conclusion(s): This study identifies key governance gaps including in public communication, managing infodemics, and inadequate coordination with Bangkok local government, and between public and private sectors on pandemic control and health service provisions. The Bangkok government had limited capacity in light of high levels of population vulnerability. These gaps were widened by political conflicts and interference. Key strengths are universal health coverage with full funding support, and health workforce commitment, innovations, and capacity to adapt interventions to the unfolding emergency. Existing social capital and civil society action increases community resilience and minimizes negative impacts on the population.Copyright © 2024 Tuangratananon, Rajatanavin, Khuntha, Rittimanomai, Asgari-Jirhandeh and Tangcharoensathien.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the current status of affiliate stigma among parents of autistic children, analyze the influencing factors, explore the relationship among mindfulness, coping styles, and affiliate stigma, and verify the mediating role of coping styles between mindfulness and affiliate stigma in parents of children with autism in China. METHOD(S): Between February and April 2023, the Child Development Behaviour Centre of a public hospital in China recruited 345 parents of children with autism. These parents completed the General Information Questionnaire, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, the Affiliate Stigma Scale, and the Simple Coping Style Questionnaire. We then adapted the Hayes Process Macro and Bootstrap method to examine the mediating effects of coping styles between mindfulness and affiliate stigma. RESULT(S): (1) The total affiliate stigma score of parents of children with autism was 48.53(SD, 10.74). Parents' age, monthly family income, duration of care, mindfulness, and coping styles were the influencing factors of parental affiliate stigma. (2) Mindfulness was positively correlated with positive coping style (r = .33, P < .01) and negatively correlated with negative coping style, affiliate stigma(r = -.38, -.39, P < .01), whereas affiliate stigma was negatively correlated with positive coping style (r = -.34, P < .01) and positively correlated with negative coping style(r = .41, P < .01). (3) Positive coping style and negative coping style play a parallel mediating role between mindfulness and affiliate stigma of parents of autistic children. CONCLUSION(S): Parents of children with autism experience significant levels of affiliate stigma. Mindfulness has a direct impact on associated stigma in parents of children with autism and also indirectly predicts associated stigma through the intermediary influence of positive and negative coping styles. Healthcare professionals could perform mindfulness interventions from an optimistic psychology viewpoint to boost parents' mindfulness and coping abilities, thereby accomplishing the objective of mitigating affiliate stigma.Copyright © 2024.

N2  - Healthcare professionals (HCPs) experienced prolonged stressful conditions during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and the global situation (particularly in the United Kingdom) meant that they continue to sustain mental stress related to the subsequent cost-of-living and healthcare budgeting crises. The psychological toll on HCPs may lead to increased staff attrition, adversely impacting the quality of patient care and work security. To help mitigate this psychological impact, the current evidence is strongly supportive of healthcare providers consistently adopting programmes fostering improvement in coping and resilience, facilitating healthy lifestyle, and allocating some resources for therapeutic strategies (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy-based strategies and other strategies specified to trauma-related issues) which can be delivered by trained professionals. We stress that some approaches are not a one-size-fits-all strategy, and we also highlight the need to encourage treatment-seeking among those who need it. These strategies are highly relevant to healthcare employers and policymakers to support all HCPs in settings marked by prolonged periods of stress. The investment in these strategies are expected not only to reduce staff attrition in the long-term, but are likely to add to the cost-effectiveness of overall healthcare budgetary allocation.Copyright © 2024

T1  - Defining Roles and Responsibilities of the Health Workforce to Respond to the Climate Crisis
A1  - Sorensen C.J.
A1  - Fried L.P. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Importance: The adverse effects of climate change are now apparent, disproportionately affecting marginalized and vulnerable populations and resulting in urgent worldwide calls to action. Health professionals occupy a critical position in the response to climate change, including in climate mitigation and adaptation, and their professional expertise and roles as health messengers are currently underused in the society-wide response to this crisis. Observations: Clinical and public health professionals have important roles and responsibilities, some of which are shared, that they must fill for society to successfully mitigate the root causes of climate change and build a health system that can reduce morbidity and mortality impacts from climate-related hazards. When viewed through a preventive framework, the unique and synergizing roles and responsibilities provide a blueprint for investment in climate change-related prevention (primary, secondary, and tertiary), capacity building, education, and training of the health workforce. Substantial investment in increasing the competence and collaboration of health professionals is required, which must be undertaken in an urgent, coordinated, and deliberate manner. Conclusions and Relevance: Exceptional collaboration, knowledge sharing, and workforce capacity building are essential to tackle the complex ways in which climate change threatens health. This framework serves as a guide for health system leaders, education institutions, policy planners, and others seeking to create a more resilient and just health system.Copyright © 2024 American Medical Association.

N2  - Nurse leaders depend upon resiliency skills to support their practice. It is important to provide opportunities for nursing students to learn, practice, and observe these skills, which are needed to navigate challenging work environments. This article describes the impact of a resiliency curricular component in a grant-funded BSN elective course, Concepts of Primary Care. Program evaluation was performed using a pre/posttest format and 2 surveys, the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) and the Brief Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS). Three open-ended questions were administered upon completion of the elective course. A concurrent nested design was utilized with a thematic analysis undertaken to analyze qualitative data. Analysis of quantitative data was performed using descriptive statistics. Undergraduate BSN students showed an overall increase in resiliency (BRS: P = .112; BCRS: P = .064), and responses to open-ended questions supported the ability to apply and analyze most of the resiliency skills presented during the didactic portion of the elective course. This course promoted the development and refinement of undergraduate BSN student resilience skills. Integration of resilience content in the primary care course also supported student professional development. The addition of resiliency concepts and skills into undergraduate nursing curricula is recommended to enhance the ability of novice nurses to address work-related challenges and promote career satisfaction for the future.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although life stress and adversity are well-known risk factors for mental health problems and cognitive impairment among older adults, limited research has comprehensively examined the impact of both childhood and adulthood adversity on psychiatric and cognitive impairment symptoms over a prolonged period. To address this issue, we investigated how lifetime adversity exposure is related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment in a nationally representative, longitudinal sample of older adults in the United States. METHOD(S): We analyzed data from the Health and Retirement Study (1992-2016). The sample included 3496 individuals (59.9% female), aged >=64 years old (Mage=76.0+/-7.6 years in 2016). We used the individual-level panel data and ordinary least squares regressions to estimate associations between childhood and adulthood adversities, and later-life depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. RESULT(S): Many participants experienced a significant early life (38%) or adulthood (79%) stressor. Moreover, experiencing one childhood adversity (vs. none) was associated with a 17.4% increased risk of adulthood adversity. Finally, as hypothesized, childhood adversity exposure was related to experiencing more depression and anxiety symptoms in later life, whereas adulthood stressor exposure predicted more cognitive impairment as well as more depression and anxiety symptoms. DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate significant associations between lifetime adversity and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment in older adults. Screening for lifetime stressors may thus help healthcare professionals and policymakers identify individuals who could potentially benefit from interventions designed to reduce stress and enhance resilience.Copyright © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of family functional care interventions among stroke caregiver dyads. This study aimed to examine the effect of a nurse-led therapeutic conversation intervention on resilience, family function, self-efficacy in managing the disease, and quality of life (QoL) in stroke family caregiver dyads. AIMS: This study aimed to examine the effect of a nurse-led therapeutic conversation intervention on resilience, family function, self-efficacy in managing the disease, and QoL in stroke-family caregiver dyads. DESIGN: This study was a single-blind (evaluator) randomized controlled trial. The planned execution time was from August 2021 to December 2022, in the rehabilitation ward of a medical university hospital. METHOD(S): A total of 82 dyads were included in this analysis. Dyads randomized to the intervention group received nurse-led therapeutic conversations intervention one at four weeks after the patient's hospitalization for a stroke. The family caregiver dyads of stroke survivors in the control group received routine care. An effectiveness analysis that included patients' resilience, self-efficacy, and patient-family caregiver dyads' family function and QoL was conducted at one month. We used the CONSORT Checklist for reporting parallel group randomized trials in this study. RESULT(S): The patients in the intervention group showed improvement in resilience and self-efficacy after one month. Furthermore, the effects on resilience (Cohen's d=0.49) and self-efficacy (Cohen's d=0.46) were significantly higher than in the control group. Family functioning was significantly higher in patient-family caregiver dyads in the intervention group than in the control group (Cohen's d=0.55; Cohen's d=0.50). However, no significant difference in QoL was found between patients and caregivers in either group. CONCLUSION(S): The intervention was effective in promoting family functioning and can also promote patient resilience and self-efficacy in disease management. However, the intervention did not have a significant effect on the QoL of patient-family caregiver dyads.Copyright © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

N2  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis glaringly highlighted the critical need to develop resilient health care systems that are better prepared for epidemics. Millions of people died from COVID-19 itself, but almost three times as many died from health system disruptions. People living with kidney disease are highly vulnerable during outbreaks and pandemics and their needs must be included in preparedness planning. Health systems preparedness requires not only early identification and containment of outbreaks and maintenance of critical services during crises, but also bolstering population resilience and ensuring the safety of both health personnel and patients. Planning for surge capacity in an outbreak must include provision for both acute and chronic dialysis, and ensure access to medications for people with kidney diseases. Quality of care should not be compromised and must be monitored and improved where necessary. Technology, such as telemedicine, can support quality and continuity of care and minimize infection risks. Communication at all levels is crucial to ensure all stakeholders, including communities, have the necessary information to support cooperation and collaboration in effective outbreak responses. Research is important during and after pandemics to improve knowledge and build resilience at all levels, from outbreak detection to the development of therapeutics and optimizing equity in access to interventions. Only with adequate preparation and more resilient health systems can we hope, as a global community, to build on the harsh lessons learned during COVID-19, and improve the response to the next infectious disease outbreak, epidemic, or even pandemic.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s)

T1  - Occupational Health Services in policing: identifying the psychological burden to OHS team members
A1  - Tehrani N. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Occupational Health Services (OHS) workers in the police are exposed to stressful and pressurized environments where they try to help employees deal with serious physical and mental health conditions. AIMS: This study used psychological surveillance to identify the level of mental health conditions within each of the police OHS (POHS) roles and to identify whether it was possible to identify the main hazards and resilience factors related to these conditions. METHOD(S): Data on mental health conditions (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] and secondary trauma) were gathered with questionnaires measuring lifestyle, coping skills, workability and illness behaviour. Personal information and average symptoms, hazards, and resilience factors were measured and compared between the POHS groups. Stepwise linear regression was used to identify the variable that explained the symptoms' level. RESULT(S): Data were gathered from 251 POHS team members working in multidisciplinary services, including OH physicians, psychologists, advisors, nurses, technicians, well-being and administrators. The results showed that POHS teams are experiencing levels of symptoms significantly higher than those found in the general population and that OH counsellors had lower levels of symptoms and sickness absence than their colleagues. The stepwise regression identified managing workloads to be associated with lower symptom levels. CONCLUSION(S): The findings illustrated the importance of a manageable workload, a stable, resilient personality and a positive attitude towards work. Using coping skills, including physical fitness, social support, involvement and getting enough sleep is associated with lower anxiety, depression, PTSD and secondary trauma symptoms.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

T1  - Lived Experience as a Protective Factor for Mental Health Workers
A1  - von Hippel C.
A1  - Brener L.
A1  - Rose G. 
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Objective: When clients do not seem to be improving, mental health workers have more negative job attitudes, experience higher levels of client-related burnout, and are more interested in leaving the field. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether all mental health workers are equally susceptible to burnout caused by feelings that their clients are not improving. Specifically, people with lived experience of mental illness are intimately familiar with their own recovery challenges and thus may be less susceptible to this source of burnout. Method(s): To test this possibility, mental health providers (N5179) from a nongovernmental community mental health organization in Australia completed a survey assessing their perceptions of client improvement from treatment, their feelings of client-related burnout, and a range of organizational outcomes (job satisfaction, job engagement, workplace well-being, and intentions to resign). Result(s): Moderated mediation analyses revealed that although mental health providers who felt that their clients were not improving experienced client-related burnout, lived experience served as a buffer. Staff with lived experience were less susceptible to burnout associated with perceptions that their clients were not improving from treatment. Mental health providers with lived experience also reported more positive job attitudes compared with providers without lived experience. Conclusion(s): Given the high rates of burnout in the mental health profession, future research should examine why lived experience appears to buffer staff from burnout when they believe that their clients are not improving. This knowledge could aid in the development of interventions to boost resilience, engagement, and longevity in the field.Copyright © 2022 American Psychiatric Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - Main objective: Analyze the level of resilience of health professionals during the Covid-19 pandemic in health centers. Methodology: A pre-experimental study of a single group without comparison level and quantitative methodology was designed, in which was applied the Wagnild and Young (1993) resilience scale. It was distributed using the snowball technique in digital format, respecting the ethics of the investigation. Main Result(s): 101 health professionals participated, reporting a low level of resilience. No statistically significant differences were found in the level of resilience between sex, age or profession. Main conclusion: Being the level of resilience low, axes of a potential individual and group intervention plan are proposed for the development of resilience and the improvement of coping. The work marks the need to investigate the optimal process of resilient development and its transfer to the work environment.Copyright © 2021, Fundacion Index. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Self-compassion enhances self-care behavior in patients with multiple sclerosis. This concept has been defined in previous studies; however, in order to effectively enhance it, patients' perceptions about and experiences with self-compassion should be first understood. Therefore, this study aims to explore the meaning of self-compassion experienced by patients with multiple sclerosis. Method(s): This directed qualitative study was conducted in 2019 in Iran. Twenty-three patients with Multiple sclerosis were selected purposefully and interviewed individually. Qualitative content analysis was used for data analysis according to Hsieh and Shannon's method. Result(s): Seventy-six primary codes were detected as well as the following eleven categories: self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, over-identification, seeking support, concealment, spiritual resilience, marital life concern, and turning into an example for others. These categories express the characteristics and meaning of self-compassion in patients with multiple sclerosis. Six of the 11 characteristics are in accordance with the theory of Neff's theory and five are related to patients and the cultural and social arena of the study environment. Conclusion(s): Results of the present study showed that new dimensions of self-compassion were found by exploring multiple sclerosis patients' experiences, which added to the suggested dimensions of others. This study is promising to nurses and paramedics as it will help them to better identify and to take better care of patients. The result will also help to design a valid tool to measure this issue of patients.Copyright Published by China Medical University 2021. © the Author(s).

N2  - Background: Hypertension is a prevalent chronic condition that affects a substantial proportion of the world's population. Medications are commonly prescribed for hypertension management, but non-pharmacological interventions like yoga are gaining popularity. Objective(s): The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy of Yoga Nidra (YN) for the management of hypertension. Method(s): A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials, i.e., non-randomized and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to investigate the effects of YN on hypertension. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, and EBSCO were searched for relevant studies published up to September 2022. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome measure was the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after YN intervention, analyzed as weighted mean difference (WMD), in comparison to control groups. The random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed for RCTs and non-RCTs using Cochrane's RoB-2 and ROBINS-I tools, respectively. Result(s): Five RCTs and three Non-RCTs involving a total of 482 participants (239 for YN vs 243 for controls) were included in this review. The meta-analysis indicated that YN significantly reduced SBP (WMD = 12.03 mm Hg, 95% CI [7.12, 16.93], Z = 4.80, p < 0.00001) and DBP (WMD = 6.32 mm Hg, 95% CI [3.53, 9.12], Z = 4.43, p < 0.00001) compared to control groups. The overall risk of bias for the three RCTs was high, whereas for the five non-RCTs, one had an overall moderate risk while the other four had an overall serious risk of bias. Discussion(s): This systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the efficacy of YN as a complementary therapy for hypertension management. YN is a safe, cost-effective, and easily accessible intervention that primarily relies on interoception and induces a deep relaxation response in practitioners, aiding them in coping with various components of high blood pressure, such as stress, vascular inflammation, peripheral vascular resistance, etc. Our understanding of the mechanisms of YN is constantly evolving, and there is a need for further research to fully explore and appreciate the significance of this ancient science and its potential efficacy on BP. Considering the results and the multifactorial role of YN, it can act as a safe and reliable adjuvant therapy to complement the pharmacological treatment of hypertension. However, further studies with larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and homogenous populations are warranted. Conclusion(s): This meta-analysis suggests that YN is effective in reducing SBP and DBP, particularly in individuals with hypertension. The results highlight the potential of YN as a complementary therapy for hypertension management. Healthcare providers may consider recommending YN to patients with hypertension as an adjuvant therapy to medication. Further studies are required to identify standardized optimal forms and durations of YN best suited for hypertension management.Copyright © 2024 The Authors

N2  - Background. Low vision (LV) has a significant negative impact on the activities of daily life as well as on the psychological health of patients. Objectives. The objective of this study is to investigate psychological, clinical, and demographic factors that may impact the daily functionality of patients with LV. Methods. A convenience sample of 53 patients, meeting the WHO criteria for LV, was recruited. Questionnaires on daily functionality, depression, and life orientation (in terms of optimism/pessimism) were administered along with a semistructured personal interview. Key Findings. The main results revealed a significant negative correlation between daily functionality and depression (r=-0.423, p<0.001). Conversely, there is a positive correlation between daily functionality and visual acuity (r=0.415, p<0.001), while years since diagnosis were negatively correlated with depression (r=-0.345, p<0.001). Depression seems to be a moderate predictor of a person's daily functionality (beta=-0.389, p<0.002), followed by visual acuity (beta=-0.344, p=0.006), explaining the 31.1% of the total variance. Conclusions. The study supports a correlation between daily functionality and both depression and visual acuity. Optimism as a personality characteristic did not factor into the prediction model for daily functionality, but it showed a strong correlation with lower levels of depressive symptoms. This highlights the potential for developing coping strategies for chronic disease management. Recommendations. The study could serve as a useful guide and may urge clinicians to pay attention to the psychological evaluation of these patients, supporting their unique emotional needs. Mental health professionals can use patients' positive resources to provide appropriate counseling and embrace the coping skills that encourage their engagement in activities of daily life.Copyright © 2024 Mara Gkioka et al.

N2  - Introduction: Studies have indicated that during times of psychological stress, physicians drink more alcohol. Problem drinking may result from psychological stress, especially stress associated to pandemics. Frontline physicians bear a disproportionate amount of the burden of this unprecedented COVID-19 situation, as they perform activities connected to the virus nonstop, which is causing psychological discomfort in them. Research on the potential consequences of stress associated to COVID-19 and the incidence of drunkenness among junior physicians in India is lacking. Aim(s): To estimate the prevalence of alcohol use, Perceived stress associated with COVID 19, any changes in alcohol dependence among junior residents of one Tertiary care center of India and any relation between Perceived stress and alcohol dependence. Material(s) and Method(s): This is an Observational Study. It's conducted at R G Kar Medical College and Hospital. 78 junior Residents of R G Kar medical college, Kolkata who are performing COVID related duties. Study was done through interview. Result(s): In Alcohol Use, the mean Familial Alcohol Use (mean+/- s.d.) of patients was 2.2+/- 2.2. Distribution of mean Familial Alcohol Use with Group was statistically significant (p=0.045). In Low, the mean Level of Stress (mean+/- s.d.) of patients was 1.7+/- 1.6In High, the mean Level of Stress (mean+/- s.d.) of patients was 3.7+/- 2.3. Distribution of mean Level of Stress with Group was statistically significant (p<0.0001). Conclusion(s): In conclusion, there will likely be a significant increase in alcohol consumption between the pre- and post-COVID eras. Additionally, the post-COVID era's high incidence of alcoholism among junior residents highlights the urgent need for comprehensive interventions aimed at addressing underlying stressors and promoting the mental health and wellbeing of healthcare professionals. Stakeholders may lessen the negative consequences of stress and alcohol abuse by encouraging an environment of openness, resilience, and support in healthcare settings. This will eventually protect junior residents' health and effectiveness while advancing the provision of high-quality patient care.Copyright © 2024 EManuscript Technologies. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) is a poorly understood but prevalent clinical phenomenon that lacks a widely accepted definition, explanatory model, or set of practice recommendations. It involves a chronic form of unipolar Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) that fails to respond to at least two first-line clinical treatments. TRD affects as many as 70 % of patients who fail to respond to their first trial of antidepressant medication and 60 % of patients who fail to respond to their first phase of psychotherapy. Purpose(s): This qualitative study aims to develop a model for understanding the phenomenon of unipolar TRD and the practices involved in its effective treatment. Method(s): This study involved a grounded theory analysis of interviews with four adult-American patients with unipolar TRD and five American providers who routinely treat such patients. Result(s): A model of unipolar TRD was developed, explaining common etiological and maintaining factors of unipolar TRD and offering recommendations for guiding effective treatment. Limitation(s): This study had a small sample size (N = 9) with limited sociodemographic diversity (all Americans; only two females; one racial/ethnic minority; no sexual minorities), which may limit its generalizability. Conclusion(s): Nevertheless, its emergent theory underscores the importance of TRD patients cultivating positive views of medication and psychotherapy while collaborating with their providers to obtain psychoeducation, build mindfulness/coping skills, enhance social support, and re-engage with pleasurable activities. It recommends that mental health providers focus on processing TRD patients' subjective experiences, validating patients' frustrations, and monitoring and calibrating patients' expectations.Copyright © 2024 The Authors

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The presence of psychospiritual supports and interventions for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) parents is unclear. PURPOSE: This systematic review examines the psychological and medical literature for psychospiritual interventions designed to support parents' mental health and psychological well-being during or after the NICU experience. DATA SOURCES: Data sources include PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) with peer-reviewed studies published between 2013 and 2023. STUDY SELECTION: Peer-reviewed studies that included spiritual and psychological intervention components focused on supporting parents during or after the NICU were included for this systematic review. There were 42 records located in 3 databases ultimately yielding 4 peer-reviewed studies that met inclusion criteria. Articles must have been written in English and evaluate parents'/caregivers' mental health/psychological well-being in relation to a psychospiritual intervention. DATA EXTRACTION: Because of the small number of studies, article summaries are provided within the results section and were written by the first author with approval by the second and third authors. RESULT(S): Results indicated that when psychological (focus on coping) and spiritual components were included psychological and well-being outcomes were better for NICU parents. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: The inclusion of psychological and spiritual aspects of coping and supportive care is necessary for the best family-centered NICU care. More work needs to be done to develop psychospiritual supports and include fathers in these endeavors as most work occurs with mothers. Nurses need support and training to facilitate family-centered care with a focus on parents' psychospiritual needs.Copyright © 2024 by The National Association of Neonatal Nurses.

N2  - Purpose of Study: There remains significant concern over declines in preventive healthcare in the COVID era, particularly among underserved communities. Completion of preventive care in Louisiana (LA) was not optimal pre-pandemic, and fell short of Healthy People 2030 targets, leaving communities vulnerable to more negative health outcomes and highlighting a need to explore and address barriers to preventive care in underserved populations. The Louisiana Community Engagement Alliance (LA-CEAL) conducted a systematic assessment of barriers to preventive care in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) across LA as a first step in developing a community-engaged strategy for increasing completion of preventive care to increase health resilience in preparation for future public health crises. Methods Used: We conducted semi-structured interviews consistent with Step 1 of the 3-step Antecedents- Targeting-Measurement (ATM) approach to logic mapping to understand the antecedent causes of declines in preventive care, culminating in a visual representation (i.e., a logic map) of the barriers to preventive care. Interviewees were 19 key FQHC stakeholders (administrators, providers, staff, patients) selected from LA-CEAL partners across LA. Starting with administrators, other participants were identified using snowball sampling. Participants were interviewed via Zoom or inperson. Individual logic maps from each interview were integrated to form one cumulative map illustrating preventive care barriers. Summary of Results: Nine administrators, 3 providers, 4 staff, and 3 patients were interviewed. Participants identified patient-, provider-, and system-level barriers to preventive care. Patient-level barriers were most abundant and included lack of transportation; high cost of care; lack of understanding of the importance of preventive care; fear regarding the unknown, COVID-19 exposure, poor health diagnoses, and side effects from treatments/ vaccines; negative perceptions of provider and/or care quality; mistrust in healthcare system/information. Provider-level barriers included a limited focus on acute problems during visits; shortcuts or overlooking of tasks; increasing patient loads with high staff turnover; burnout and low morale in the workplace; high EHR burden. System-level barriers included long wait times for referral services; major delays in scheduling preventive care visits; staff shortages. Conclusion(s): Interviews with FQHC stakeholders revealed multiple patient-, provider-, and health systemlevel barriers to preventive care. Testing strategies that overcome barriers to preventive care may improve the health resilience of communities across LA.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Half of mental health problems are established by the age of 14 years and 75% by 24 years. Early intervention and prevention of mental ill health are therefore vitally important. However, increased demand over recent years has meant that access to child mental health services is often restricted to those in severest need. Watch Me Play! (WMP) is an early intervention designed to support caregiver attunement and attention to the child to promote social-emotional well-being and thereby mental health resilience. Originally developed in the context of a local authority mental health service for children in care, it is now also delivered online as a low intensity, scalable, preventative intervention. Although WMP shows promise and is already used in some services, we do not yet know whether it is effective. Method(s): A non-randomised single group feasibility study with embedded process evaluation. We propose to recruit up to 40 parents/carers of children aged 0-8 years who have been referred to early years and children's services in the UK. WMP involves a parent watching the child play and talking to their child about their play (or for babies, observing and following signals) for up to 20 min per session. Some sessions are facilitated by a trained practitioner who provides prompts where necessary, gives feedback, and discusses the child's play with the caregiver. Services will offer five facilitated sessions, and parents will be asked to do at least 10 additional sessions on their own with their child in a 5-week period. Feasibility outcomes examined are as follows: (i) recruitment, (ii) retention, (iii) adherence, (iv) fidelity of delivery, (v) barriers and facilitators of participation, (vi) intervention acceptability, (vii) description of usual care, and (viii) data collection procedures. Intervention mechanisms will be examined through qualitative interview data. Economic evaluation will be conducted estimating cost of the intervention and cost of service use for child and parents/carers quality-adjusted life years. Discussion(s): This study will address feasibility questions associated with progression to a future randomised trial of WMP. Trial registration: ISRCTN13644899.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined mental health symptom trajectories and engagement in mental health follow-up in relation to mechanism of injury. This study examined differences in engagement between survivors of nonviolent and violent injury in the Trauma Resilience and Recovery Program (TRRP), a stepped-care, technology-enhanced model that provides evidence-based mental health screening and treatment to patients admitted to our Level I trauma service. METHOD(S): This study analyzed data from 2,527 adults enrolled in TRRP at hospital bedside between 2018 and 2022, including 398 patients (16%) with a violent injury and 2,129 patients (84%) with a nonviolent injury. Bivariate and hierarchical logistic regression analyses examined relations between injury type (violent vs. nonviolent) engagement in TRRP and mental health symptoms at 30 day follow-up. RESULT(S): Engagement in services at bedside was similar across survivors of violent and nonviolent traumatic injury. Patients with violent injury had higher levels of posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms 30 days postinjury but were less likely to engage in mental health screening. Among patients who screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, patients with violent injury were more likely to accept treatment referrals. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with a violent traumatic injury have higher levels of mental health needs yet face greater barriers to accessing mental health services following their injury relative to those with a nonviolent injury. Effective strategies are needed to ensure continuity of care and access to mental health care to promote resilience and emotional and functional recovery.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: Identify subgroups of patients with distinct joint anxiety AND depression profiles and evaluate for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as stress, resilience, and coping. Design(s): Longitudinal study Participants: Patients (n = 1328) receiving chemotherapy. Method(s): Measures of state anxiety and depression were done six times over two cycles of chemotherapy. All of the other measures were completed prior to second or third cycle of chemotherapy. Latent profile analysis was used to identify the distinct joint anxiety and depression profiles. Finding(s): Three classes were identified (i.e. Low Anxiety and Low Depression (57.5%); Moderate Anxiety and Moderate Depression (33.7%), High Anxiety and High Depression (8.8%)). For all of the stress measures, a dose response effect was seen among the profiles. Two worst profiles reported higher occurrence rates for a number of adverse childhood experiences. Implications for providers: Patients need referrals for stress reduction techniques and mental health and social services.Copyright © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - postintervention (difference, -6.0 points; 95% CI, -8.8 to -3.3 points; P = .03), significantly decreased depression at posttraining (difference, -5.7 points; 95% CI, -8.6 to -2.8 points; P < .001) and postintervention (difference, -5.4 points; 95% CI, -8.3 to -2.5 points; P < .001), and significantly decreased anxiety at postintervention. In addition, there was a significant decrease in insomnia from baseline to postintervention in the SKY group (difference, -0.3 points; 95% CI, -2.3 to 1.7 points; P = .01). The SKY group also showed significantly increased professional fulfillment as well as significant decreases in work exhaustion, interpersonal disengagement, and burnout. There was no effect on self-reported medical errors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial, physicians who regularly practiced SKY throughout a 2-month period experienced improvements in wellness and decreased burnout. These data suggest that SKY may be an effective, practical, and safe strategy to increase wellness and mitigate burnout in physicians., IMPORTANCE Physicians are exposed to high stress and strain that results in burnout, which affects them, their families, their patients, and the entire health care system; thus, there is an urgent need to develop methods to increase the resiliency of physicians. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) is a comprehensive yoga breathing and meditation-based program that is a potential approach to mitigate physician burnout. OBJECTIVE To determine whether SKY can reduce psychological distress and improve wellness in physicians. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial assessed the potential efficacy of SKY compared with a stress management education (SME) training as control. This study was conducted online from November 11, 2021, to March 14, 2022, and included physicians from Turkey, Germany, and Dubai. Both the SKY and the SME control groups received 1.5 hours of training for 3 consecutive days via a group video conference call. Participants were physicians willing to do some form of relaxation exercise everyday for 2 months. Exclusion criteria included presence of major illness and maintaining a regular mind-body program practice. Statistical analysis took place from March to November 2023. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 into 2 groups-the SKY group or the SME (control) group-using a computer algorithm. After the 3-day instruction period, the participants in the SKY group practiced for approximately 30 minutes per day on their own and participated in a weekly 1-hour, group-based online follow-up practice. After the 3-day instruction period, participants in the SME group reviewed and applied the notes from stress management education training at their initiative and had a weekly 1-hour group-based online follow-up session. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were stress and depression (measured by the 42-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale [DASS-42]) and insomnia measured by the Regensburg Insomnia Scale (RIS) with primary end point at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included anxiety (DASS-42); optimism (Life Orientation Test-Revised [LOT-R]); professional fulfillment, work exhaustion, interpersonal disengagement, and overall burnout (Professional Fulfillment Index [PFI]); and self-reported professional errors (Self-Reported Professional Error Questionnaire). RESULTS This study included 129 participants (SME, 63 participants [48.9%]; SKY, 66 participants [51.1%]; 115 females [89.2%]; 14 males [10.8%]; mean [SD] age, 46.2 [9.0] years). Compared with the SME control group, participants in the SKY group had significantly decreased stress on the DASS-42 at posttraining (difference, -6.8 points; 95% CI, -9.6 to -4.1 points; P = .006) and atCopyright © 2024 American Medical Association.

N2  - Background: In 2023, wildfires led to widespread destruction of property and displacement of residents in Alberta and Nova Scotia, Canada. Previous research suggests that wildfires increase the psychological burden of impacted communities, necessitating population-level interventions. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)-based text message interventions, Text4HopeAB and Text4HopeNS, were launched in Alberta and Nova Scotia, respectively, during the 2023 wildfire season to support the mental health of impacted individuals. Objective(s): The study examines the effectiveness of Text4HopeNS and Text4HopeAB in alleviating psychological symptoms and improving wellbeing among subscribers. Method(s): The study involved longitudinal and naturalistic controlled trial designs. The longitudinal study comprised subscribers who completed program surveys at baseline and six weeks post-enrolment, while the naturalistic controlled study compared psychological symptoms in subscribers who had received daily supportive text messages for six weeks (intervention group) and new subscribers who had enrolled in the program during the same period but had not yet received any text messages (control group). The severity of low resilience, poor mental wellbeing, likely Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), likely Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and suicidal ideation were measured on the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), the World Health Organization-5 Wellbeing Index (WHO-5), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale, PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), and the ninth question on the PHQ-9, respectively. The paired and independent sample t-tests were employed in data analysis. Result(s): The results from the longitudinal study indicated a significant reduction in the mean scores on the PHQ-9 (-12.3%), GAD-7 (-14.8%), and the PCL-C (-5.8%), and an increase in the mean score on the WHO-5, but not on the BRS, from baseline to six weeks. In the naturalistic controlled study, the intervention group had a significantly lower mean score on the PHQ-9 (-30.1%), GAD-7 (-29.4%), PCL-C (-17.5%), and the ninth question on the PHQ-9 (-60.0%) which measures the intensity of suicidal ideation, and an increase in the mean score on the WHO-5 (+24.7%), but not on the BRS, from baseline to six weeks compared to the control group. Conclusion(s): The results of this study suggests that the Text4Hope program is an effective intervention for mitigating psychological symptoms in subscribers during wildfires. This CBT-based text messaging program can be adapted to provide effective support for individuals' mental health, especially in the context of traumatic events and adverse experiences such as those induced by climate change. Policymakers and mental health professionals should consider these findings when shaping strategies for future disaster response efforts, emphasizing the value of scalable and culturally sensitive mental health interventions.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Having a sufficient and well-functioning health workforce is crucial for reducing the burden of disease and premature death. Health workforce development, focusing on availability, recruitment, retention, and education, is inseparable from acceptability, motivation, burnout, role and responsibility, and performance. Each aspect of workforce development may face several challenges, requiring specific strategies. However, there was little evidence on barriers and strategies towards comprehensive health workforce development. Therefore, this review explored barriers and strategies for health workforce development at the primary health care level around the world. METHOD(S): A scoping review of reviews was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews. The article search was performed in Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE. We used EndNote x9 for managing the collected articles, screening processes, and citation purpose. The scoping review included any kind of review articles on the application of health workforce development concepts, such as availability, recruitment, retention, role and responsibility, education and training, motivation, and burnout, with primary health care and published in English anywhere in the world. Based on the concepts above, barriers and strategies for health workforce development were identified. The findings were synthesized qualitatively based on the building blocks of the health system framework. The analysis involved specific activities such as familiarization, construction of the thematic framework, indexing, charting, and interpretation. The results were presented in texts, tables, and figures. RESULT(S): The search strategies yielded 7,276 papers were found. Of which, 69 were included in the scoping review. The most frequently cited barriers were financial challenges and issues related to health care delivery, such as workloads. Barriers affecting healthcare providers directly, including lack of training and ineffective teamwork, were also prominent. Other health system and governance barriers include lack of support, unclear responsibility, and inequity. Another notable barrier was the shortage of health care technology, which pertains to both health care supplies and information technology. The most common cited effective strategies were ongoing support and supervision, engaging with communities, establishing appropriate primary care settings, financial incentives, fostering teamwork, and promoting autonomous health care practice. CONCLUSION(S): Effective leadership/governance, a robust health financing system, integration of health information and technology, such as mobile health and ensuring a consistent supply of adequate resources are also vital components of primary health care workforce development. The findings highlight the importance of continuous professional development, which includes training new cadres, implementing effective recruitment and retention mechanisms, optimising the skill mix, and promoting workplace wellness. These elements are essential in fostering a well-trained and resilient primary health care workforce.Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - PURPOSE: Caring for a child or youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) can be overwhelming. Parents and caregivers may experience psychosocial distress, such as depression, frustration, and hopelessness. The purpose of the current study was to gain further insight into families' perspectives on the psychosocial impacts of caring for CYSHCN to identify gaps in health care systems and strengthen systems of support. METHOD(S): A qualitative descriptive design was used in 16 parents and caregivers. Colaizzi's method of analysis and semi-structured interviews were used. RESULT(S): Six themes emerged from this study: (1) Stigma and Isolation, (2) Religion as a Coping Mechanism, (3) Financial Challenges, (4) Bearing the Burden, (5) Familial Denial, and (6) System-Related Concerns. CONCLUSION(S): Psychiatric-mental health nurses (PMHNs) are in a pivotal position to use their knowledge, skills, and experiences to guide families. PMHNs can also engage communities and enhance mental health promotion to break the stigma associated with having a CYSHCN.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused critical mental health issues and lifestyle disruptions. The aim of this study was to explore, during the lockdown of second-wave contagions in Italy, how stress was affected by dispositional (personality factors and intolerance to uncertainty) and behavioral (coping strategies) dimensions, how these variables differed among sex, age, educational, professional, and health groups, and how the various changes in work and daily routine intervened in the psychological impact of the emergency. Our results highlight that women, the youngs, students/trainees, those with chronic diseases, those who stopped their jobs due to restrictions, and those who left home less than twice a week were more stressed, while health professionals showed lower levels of the same construct. Those with higher levels of stress used more coping strategies based on avoidance, which positively correlated with age, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and intolerance to uncertainty, and negatively with openness. Stress levels also positively correlated with agreeableness, conscientiousness, intolerance to uncertainty, and seeking of social support, and negatively with openness, a positive attitude, and a transcendent orientation. Finally, stress was predicted mainly by behavioral dimensions. Our results are discussed and framed within the literature, as important insights for targeted intervention strategies to promote health even in emergencies.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.

N2  - As the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) continued to provide uninterrupted health care service delivery; therefore, this disproportionately affected their wellbeing. Our study explored the wellbeing of HCWs during the COVID-19 era in public health facilities in the City of Johannesburg, Gauteng province, South Africa. A qualitative study was conducted among twenty (20) HCWs through face-to-face in-depth interviews (IDIs) in the form of semi-structured interviews, audiotapes, and transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed with NVivo version 10. The findings showed that over half of HCWs (aged between 27 and 60 years) tested positive for COVID-19. Also, one third of HCWs' family members tested positive while some died due to COVID-19 infection. Informed by the workers' wellbeing framework, four themes emerged with fourteen sub-themes. Firstly, unsafe work environment was characterized by human resource related challenges such as increased workload; staff shortage; insufficient resources, e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE); poor policies in terms of compensation/allowance for being infected with COVID-19; poor health services; and death of colleagues. Secondly, poor health outcomes were described as strained emotional (psychosocial distress) and physical (respiratory related conditions) wellbeing. Thirdly, home and community environments were negatively impacted by interrupted relationships with family and friends, and experiences of deaths of loved ones. Finally, HCWs engaged personal wellbeing strategies through self-motivation; staying positive; family support; and participating in resilience-promoting extra mural activities to cope during the pandemic. In conclusion, the wellbeing of HCWs was aggravated during the COVID-19 era and led to low morale and compromised healthcare quality. This study advocates for promotion of greater resilience, and psychological and physical safety of HCWs through evidence-based, multilevel-multicomponent interventions at the workplace, home, and community environments in addition to strengthening public health policies and response to future pandemics.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.

N2  - Exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) is a pervasive threat for military service members and may be associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. However, coping mechanisms, such as mindfulness, may ameliorate symptoms and improve recovery. Two studies were conducted to test dispositional mindfulness as a moderator of the links between PMIEs, as assessed using the Moral Injury Events Scale (i.e., total score and Self-Transgression, Other-Transgression, and Betrayal subscale scores), and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation among different samples of active-duty soldiers in garrison. In Sample 1 (N = 310), mindfulness buffered the links between PMIE exposure and symptoms of both anxiety, R2 = .02, and depression, R2 = .03. In Sample 2 (N = 669), mindfulness moderated the link between the MIES Betrayal subscale and anxiety symptoms, R2 = .01. The results suggest that dispositional mindfulness may be a protective factor against some of the negative impacts of PMIE exposure. Further implications are discussed.Copyright © 2024 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.

N2  - Emerging evidence suggests video-assisted health education being an effective way in promoting rehabilitation. The present study was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of video-assisted health education in promoting rehabilitation training in postoperative OA patients and at comparing it with oral education. This study was a noncontemporaneous control study involving 179 patients who underwent TKA. For the intervention group, a bedside interactive system that recorded a series of educational videos showing a rehabilitation training program was established. For the control group, oral education having the same content as that in the videos for the intervention group was provided. After education, clinical outcomes such as occurrence of complications, circulating biomarkers of inflammation, and rehabilitation progress of the patients were obtained. Furthermore, job stress and burnout in nurses who participated in the present study were assessed. Results showed that C-reactive protein levels of patients were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (84.54+/-36.09 vs. 99.45+/-31.73 mg/L, P=0.004). Faster achievement of postoperative knee flexion to 90 degrees (21.31+/-5.83 vs. 35.72+/-9.93 h, P<0.001) and first ambulation (19.91+/-4.57 vs. 50.15+/-7.00 h, P<0.001), reduced number of postoperative complications such as postoperative orthostatic intolerance (7 vs. 19, P=0.008) and constipation (10 vs. 23, P=0.009), and reduced length of hospital stay (7.51+/-1.79 vs. 8.21+/-2.15 days, P=0.019) in the intervention group in comparison to the control group were noted. Emotional exhaustion and burnout of nurses were reduced significantly in the intervention group than in the control group (21.00+/-8.04 vs. 36.50+/-11.22, P=0.002; 55.90+/-11.57 vs. 85.50+/-6.80, P<0.001, respectively). Reduced personal accomplishments in nurses were improved significantly in the intervention group when compared with the control group (41.90+/-4.91 vs. 32.80+/-7.07, P=0.004). We concluded that video-assisted health education may promote TKA patient recovery and reduce burnout and stress in nurses when compared with oral education. Video-assisted health education could be helpful in situation where manpower of nurse is in shortage.Copyright © 2021 Ping Li et al.

N2  - Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (I-CBT) is effective in treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, offering enhanced accessibility and cost-effectiveness. However, it's important to note that these technologies may not be suitable for all age groups. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine if the effectiveness of I-CBT in treating PTSD varies based on the patients' mean age. We conducted a systematic review of the literature, focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the ISI Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases. Following this, we performed a meta-analysis and evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias quality assessment tool. In this study, we examined patient-related factors (civil or military status, age, and gender), clinical characteristics (baseline PTSD severity and type of trauma), and treatment characteristics (type of intervention, synchronous or asynchronous delivery, and the number of sessions) as independent variables. The dependent variable was the reduction in mean PTSD symptoms. Five RCTs out of 1,552 screened studies were included in this review, all of which showed some level of concern regarding potential bias. Our meta-analysis indicates that I-CBT is equally effective regardless of patients' mean age. Since all RCTs included only provide the mean age of the patients, further randomized controlled trials should address the effectiveness of I-CBT among different age groups.

N2  - As healthcare provision models are evolving rapidly due to social and political changes, patient and family-centered intensive care unit (ICU) care remains a vital component of quality healthcare delivery. This approach to ICU care emphasizes open communication, shared decision-making, and collaboration between healthcare providers, patients, and families. Centering around the belief that patients and families are essential members of the healthcare team, patient and family-centered care has been shown to improve patient outcomes, reduce the length of stay, and increase both patient and family satisfaction. Current international guidelines are heavily based on research undertaken in USA, with fewer examples from the rest of the world and most existing resources and publications are in English. Method(s): An exploratory study and expert sessions. To explore how patient and family-centered ICU care might be better promoted in low-middle income countries, an international team of investigators met virtually with several goals. The first goal was to conduct moderated "brainstorming" discussion sessions concerning their clinical experience in their nation and how it compares with international recommendations and practices. The second goal was to develop an approved survey tool in English and Spanish directed at a convenience sample of ICU healthcare practitioners located around the world. These survey responses received provided an initial snapshot intended to guide further efforts. Result(s): In this 2023 update, we explore the latest trends and best practices in patient and family-centered ICU care across Latin America, Asia, Africa and Middle-East. 461 surveys have been answered by 19/03/23. The survey results and brainstorming sessions demonstrated differences in approaches to ICU care that varied internationally; we attributed these differences to variations in hospital resources, social, cultural differences (e.g., religious, educational barriers), and medico-legal and safety issues. We also noted there has been an increasing emphasis on the importance of psychosocial support for patients and families in the ICU. Conclusion(s): Critical illness can be a traumatic experience, and patients and families may experience a range of emotions, including fear, anxiety, and depression. Many ICUs now offer support services, such as social work, spiritual care, and mental health counselling, to help patients and families cope with the emotional and psychological impact of critical illness. In addition, patient and family-centered ICU care can help promote cultural competence and diversity. By involving patients and families in care planning and decision-making, healthcare providers can better understand the unique needs and preferences of different cultural and ethnic groups.Copyright © 2024

N2  - Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic has been a lengthy and agonizing journey for critical care healthcare professionals (CCHP) [1]. Stressors such as increased work hours and workload, direct exposure to infected patients, lack of personal protective equipment, and frequent confrontations with morbidity and mortality has taken a toll on an already burnt-out profession [1]. This experience has emanated a range of psychiatric morbidities amongst CCHPs, such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorders [2]. Action is imperative to prevent conceivable implications on both the organization and society at large, yet there exist minimal individual-focused interventions for such population [1]. This study aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a realist-informed Individualized Psychosocial Intervention (IPI), which was theoretically developed to improve well-being and decrease burn-out symptoms amongst CCHPs. Patients and Methods: A parallel-designed, two arm, pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted on N = 30 CCHPs from Australia and New Zealand, who acquired less than 37 on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Participants were randomized into a six-week treatment (IPI) or active control (informal virtual debrief) group using 1:1 allocation ratio. IPI included a virtual platform for a once-off individual psychologist consultation and weekly psychologist-mediated, problem-solving peer debrief. Feasibility was assessed based on the process of registration, recruitment, participation, and attended sessions, whilst acceptability assessed participant satisfaction. An audit of the study log assisted with assessing feasibility outcomes, whereas a semi-structured individual interview was conducted to determine acceptability. Result(s): Feasibility results revealed high reach in registration (N = 110, 1-month recruitment length), recruitment (80%), and excellent participation (93% both groups). Adherence was greater in treatment (82%) compared to the active control (66%) group. Both groups were acceptable, with feedback reporting greater favorability to the treatment group, which was determined by comparing discussion themes of engagement, structure, personalization and self-directed learning. Participants felt IPI provided guidance, yet independence and flexibility to manage their stressors. Participants that perceived themselves as having high well-being were also able to benefit from IPI as they were able to resonate with the discussion topics and contribute their knowledge and skills. Conclusion(s): IPI was highly feasible and acceptable when implemented amongst CCHPs within different stages in their well-being and burn-out experiences. Participant feedback assisted in understanding potential improvements, which will be beneficial when designing a larger-scale study of individual-interventions. We believe IPI is a promising personal resource for CCHPs to combat the impacts of burn-out, especially during the critical recovery period post-pandemic.Copyright © 2024

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic created global disruption in health professions education and healthcare practice, necessitating an abrupt move to digital delivery. A longitudinal survey was conducted to track the evolution of global responses to the pandemic. During the initial stages, educational and health institutions were forced to adapt quickly without careful consideration of optimal pedagogy, practices, and effectiveness of implemented approaches. In this paper, we report the results of Phase 3 of the global survey that was distributed between November 2021 and February 2022 through InterprofessionalResearch.Global (IPR.Global). The Phase 3 qualitative survey received 27 responses, representing 25 institutions from 27 countries in 6 regions. Using inductive thematic analysis, the data analysis resulted in three emerging themes: Impact of the pandemic on the delivery of interprofessional education and collaborative practice (IPECP); Impact of the pandemic on the healthcare system (team, population/client health, clients); and Sustainability and innovation. This study highlights the evolving nature of health education and collaborative practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. IPECP educators need to be resilient and deal with the complexities of face-to-face and digital learning delivery. Preparing for emerging forms of teamwork is essential for new work contexts and optimal health services.

N2  - NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN) is a rare genetic disorder and is associated with progressive morbidities. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between NF2-SWN disease severity, health-related Quality of Life (QoL), and mental health aspects of patients. Standardised questionnaires assessing mental health problems (symptoms of depression, anxiety, and somatic burden), psychological factors (resilience, loneliness, and personality functioning), and health-related QoL were administered to 97 patients with NF2-SWN. The results of these questionnaires were compared with physician-rated disease severity. Questionnaires were completed by 77 patients. Physician-rated disease severity scores were available for 55 patients. NF2-SWN patients showed a high prevalence of clinically relevant symptoms of depression (30%), anxiety (16%), and somatic burden (32%). Almost all variables showed moderate to high correlations with NF2-SWN-related QoL. NF2-SWN-related QoL was associated with physician-reported disease severity (r=0.614). In the stepwise hierarchical linear regression analysis, a significant model with four predictors (disease severity type, depression symptoms, personality functioning, and gender) explained 64% of the variance in NF2-SWN-related QoL. Our results showed a strong association between NF2-SWN-related QoL and depression symptoms. Moreover, personality functioning is an important influencing factor, representing a modifiable construct that can be targeted by prevention programs or psychotherapy.Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

N2  - Background: China faces various public health emergencies, and emergency responders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC emergency responders) are a mainstay in responding to public health emergencies. Career resilience can help CDC emergency responders to effectively respond to and recover from public health emergencies, but there is no specific measurement instrument available. In this study, we aimed to develop and conduct an initial validation of the career resilience instrument for CDC emergency responders in China within the context of public health emergencies from a process perspective. Method(s): Based on a survey conducted in Shanghai, interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA), which is a qualitative research approach to describing and analyzing individual experiences, was used to analyze the interview texts to develop the initial career resilience instrument for CDC emergency responders. The initial career resilience instrument was revised through two rounds of expert consultation. Cronbach's alpha coefficient and exploratory factor analysis were used to test the reliability and validity of the revised career resilience instrument. Result(s): The initial career resilience instrument for CDC emergency responders contained three first-level measurement dimensions, 9second-level measurement dimensions, and 52 measurement items. After expert consultation, the first-level and second-level measurement dimensions were not revised, 13 measurement items were deleted or revised, and six measurement items were added, resulting in 48 measurement items. The revised career resilience instrument was tested for good reliability and validity. Conclusion(s): Career resilience for CDC emergency responders can be regarded as a set of protective factors and dynamic processes that can be cultivated and intervened in cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions to improve their ability to respond to and recover from public health emergencies.Copyright © 2024 Wang, Cheng, Fu, Luo, Li, Wang and Jin.

T1  - Tickling the heart: integrating social emotional learning into medical education to cultivate empathetic, resilient, and holistically developed physicians

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Objectives: Advancements in technology have improved healthcare quality but shifted the focus to efficiency, negatively impacting patient- doctor relationships. This study proposes integrating social-emotional learning (SEL) into medical education to address this issue. Key arguments: Social-emotional learning (SEL) is based on social learning theory and has a focus on emotion management, stress management, empathy, and social skills. Through SEL, students can develop social and emotional skills by observing, interacting with, and imitating others. Incorporating SEL into medical education would ensure that physicians develop the social and emotional skills necessary to form positive relationships with patients and to cope with the emotional demands of medical work. SEL comprises six domains, namely, the cognitive, emotion, social, values, perspective, and identity domains. These six domains are closely related to the six core competencies the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) indicated every doctor should possess, which indicates that the domains of SEL are highly relevant within the context of medical education. Furthermore, SEL can lead to the development of empathy, which can improve physicians' ability to understand patients' perspectives and emotions, and resilience, which can enable physicians to more effectively cope with the demands of their work, and it can lead to holistic development, with doctors gaining an understanding of both the technical and humanistic aspects of their work. Conclusion(s): Incorporating SEL in medical education would enable doctors to develop key social and emotional skills that would improve their ability to provide holistic medical services and therefore would improve overall medical systems.Copyright © 2024 Hsu, Fuh and Liao.

N2  - Introduction: Dialysis treatment is a very long-term process that affects and challenges patients and families as much as the disease itself. Along with dialysis treatment, the caregiver has to go to the dialysis center 3-4 days a week and spend most of the day there, or take responsibility for the treatment in home treatments, apply the treatments, cope with and manage the physical and psychological problems of the patient. It has also been shown in some studies that these obligations affect the caregiver and this situation causes problems such as physical-psychological problems, deterioration of family relations and financial problems in caregivers. The aim of the study is to reveal the burden of caregivers of chronic kidney patients, their level of health perception and self-care, and the problems of caring for chronic patients Methods: The research was carried out in descriptive and relationship-seeking design. The sample size was determined as 262 by taking into account the effect size (p) of 0.2, the alpha error of 0.05 and the power probability of 95% by power analysis. The data were collected using the Introductory Information Form, Zarit Caregiving Burden Scale, Health Perception Scale, Conscious Self-Care Scale, Maslach Burnout Scale. Result(s): Caregivers are distributed according to gender as 101 (40.7%) male and 147 (59.3%) female. Caregivers stated their general health status as poor in 15 (6.0%), moderate in 109 (44.0%), good in 112 (45.2%) and very good in 12 (4.8%). The mean "burden of caregiving" of caregivers was 25.653+/-16.663 (Min=0; Max=84), the mean of "health perception" was 38,790+/-8,556 (Min=15; Max=57), "mindful self-care" mean 103.976+/-23.822 (Min=45; Max = 159). When correlation analyzes are examined; A correlation was found between mindful self-care and caregiving burden at r=-0.226 negative very weak (p=0.000<0.05) level. Regression analysis to determine the cause-and-effect relationship between educational status, presence of health insurance, presence of someone else in the family who needs care and health perception was found to be significant (F=15.570; p=0.000<0.05). Regression analysis to determine the cause-and-effect relationship between educational status, caregiving burden, finding the work tiring and finding the work tiring, general health status and conscious self-care was found to be significant (F=12.523; p=0.000<0.05). Conclusion(s): Healthcare professionals need to focus not only on the health of patients, but also on the health of their relatives and caregivers, which is a key element of home care, because if the caregiver is under a high degree of burden, it is more likely that the needs of the patients will not be met. Evaluation of the process and effects of caregivers and their perception and maintenance of their own health and self-care will provide data for the planning of initiatives that can be made to improve the well-being and quality of life of both caregivers and their patients throughout this chronic disease journey. I have no potential conflict of interest to disclose.Copyright © 2024

N2  - Background: Assessing the education, information, and support needs of Canadians diagnosed with breast cancer involves categorizing and tailoring topics and methods of delivery but, most importantly, it must be rooted in an understating of the patient. In 2022, CBCN initiated a project to identify the needs of the Canadian breast cancer population in order to develop tailored programs and materials. Method(s): CBCN conducted a series of 45-minute key informant interviews (7) with patients and oncologists to determine needs, gaps, programs, and materials. Five 90-minute patient focus groups (32 participants) were conducted to enhance the interviews. One group was specifically for metastatic patients. Findings from the interviews and focus groups were used to inform the questions for a survey which was fielded online between May and June 2022. The data analysis began in September 2022 and is on-going. Result(s): Stage IV respondents (n = 49) were asked to rate the levels ("High", "Moderate", "Low", and "Did Not Experience") of emotional and psychological experiences they had at diagnosis and during treatment. 67.4% of stage IV respondents reported a "High" level of worry at diagnosis compared to 37.8% that reported the same during treatment. A "High" level of anxiety was reported by 60.9% of respondents at diagnosis and by 42.2% of respondents during treatment. 60.9% of respondents rated their level of fear as "High at diagnosis and 40.0% rated it as "High" during treatment. While there was some change in patients reported levels of worry, anxiety, and fear from diagnosis to onset of treatment, patients continued to experience these in the "High" to "Moderate" range. Conclusion(s): Assessing patients' emotional and psychological states at diagnosis and providing a referral to a mental health professional might enable patients and their healthcare team to address these concerns early on and continue to be monitored. Offering stage IV patients support strategies in person or online, such as counseling, coping skills, activity-based support, or peer-to-peer networking, might also provide on-going opportunities to manage their psychological/emotional health when they are first diagnosed with breast cancer and as they continue to be treated for it.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - OBJECTIVE: to analyze the effects of a Mindfulness-based intervention on nurse leaders' emotional intelligence and resilience. METHOD(S): a pilot study of a randomized crossover clinical trial. The sample (n=32) was randomized into Group A (n=18) and Group B (n=14) and evaluated at the pre-test, post-test and follow-up moments. The outcomes were assessed using the Emotional Intelligence Measure, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Questionnaire and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, and analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. RESULT(S): a total of 32 nurses with a mean age of 42.6 years old were evaluated. The analyses showed significant interactions between the effects of the group x moment factors on the Self-motivation (p=0.005), Sociability (p<0.001), Self-control (p=0.013), and Total (p=0.002) emotional intelligence skill scores; as well as on the Observe (p=0.042), Describe (p=0.008), Non-judgment (p<0.001), Act with awareness (p=0.004) and Total (p<0.001) mindfulness facets. Post-test: there was a statistically significant increase in the Sociability (p=0.009) and Self-control (p=0.015) emotional intelligence skills; as well as in the Non-judgment (p=0.022) and Total (p=0.002) mindfulness facets. Follow-up: a significant increase was observed in the Non-judgment (p=0.024) and Total (p=0.026) mindfulness facets. The "resilience" variable did not present statistical significance in the "group x moment" factor, both in the post-test and during follow-up. CONCLUSION(S): the Mindfulness-based intervention used proved to be effective in increasing nurse leaders' emotional intelligence and dispositional mindfulness skills.

N2  - Background: In China, mental health services do not currently meet the needs of bereaved people with symptoms of prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Internet-based grief interventions may help fill this gap, but such programmes have not yet been developed or evaluated in China. The proposed study aims to investigate the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of an online self-help intervention programme named Healing Grief for bereaved Chinese with prolonged grief, and to explore the psychological mechanisms of potential improvements. Method(s): We designed a two-arm randomised controlled trial. At least 128 participants will be randomly assigned to either an Internet-based intervention group or a waitlist-control group. The Internet-based intervention will be developed based on the dual process model, integrating techniques of psychoeducation, behavioural activation, cognitive reappraisal, and meaning reconstruction, and will be delivered via expressive writing. The intervention comprises six modules, with two sessions in each module, and requires participants to complete two sessions per week and complete the intervention in 6 weeks. The primary outcomes include effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility. The effectiveness will be assessed by measures of prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Acceptability and feasibility will be evaluated using survey and interview on user experience characteristics. Secondary outcomes include moderators and mediators, such as dual process coping, grief rumination, mindfulness, and continuing bond, to explore the psychological mechanisms of potential improvement. Assessments will take place at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Conclusion(s): The proposed study will determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of the newly developed online self-help intervention for bereaved Chinese with prolonged grief and clarify how the intervention helps with symptom improvements. Such an intervention may play an important role in easing the imbalance between the delivery and receipt of bereavement psychological services in China.

N2  - Background Measuring competencies in nursing is critical to ensure safe and effective care of patients. Usually, new nurses struggle to cope with the demands of new roles and face difficulties in completing the required competencies on time. Being a clinical resource nurse based in the clinical areas and responsible for new nurses, I have observed that there is a gap in this area which may impact on patient safety. I work as a clinical resource nurse in Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz Hospital in Madinah (PMBAH), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The focus of this paper is to assess the knowledge and confidence of newly hired nurses in PMBAH. Currently, new nurses are given 5 days of orientation in class and are then sent to clinical areas to start working under a senior nurse. The aim of this study was to assess the confidence and knowledge of new nurses hired by PMBAH. Methods Simulation methodology was used to train new nurses in PMBAH. A 2-day training schedule was arranged with 2 hours for each competency session, with eight sessions in total. Each session included a short briefing about the scenario and introductory video followed by a demonstration by the simulation facilitator. The new nurse was then allowed to run the scenario with no interruption, followed by individual briefing directly to consolidate and transform the nurse's experience. Nurses were allowed to express their feelings in their own words. Pre and post self-assessment of participants' knowledge and confidence were later assessed. Results There was a big difference in the pre- and post-assessment results; the majority of the nurses have shown increased knowledge and confidence after going through simulation sessions. Conclusion We have identified that simulation positively impacts nurses' learning experiences by replicating the bedside setting in a mistake-free environment. Therefore, simulation sessions for new nurses are very helpful to raise knowledge, confidence, and the ultimate safe delivery of patient care. We can claim that simulation is an up-to-date and innovative learning strategy, especially when addressing direct patient care aspects including nursing skills and procedures. With the current increase in medicolegal cases, we can conclude that simulation is both a safer and economically viable way of training nurses. Increased confidence and knowledge using simulation during orientation has been shown to reduce stress levels in clinical areas.

N2  - Background: Critically ill ventilated patients are often treated with continuous infusions of opioids and/or benzodiazepines in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to decrease pain and anxiety. Nevertheless, administration of these drugs has been associated with unintended consequences such as delirium and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and may potentially lead to addiction. Cannabinoid-based therapy has been effectively used to alleviate pain, anxiety and manage PTSD among patients in other settings with potentially fewer side effects. Despite this potential, the use of cannabinoids as an alternative to conventional medications is not without resistance, stigma or challenges from various perspectives or systems (i.e. infrastructure, regulation). Objective(s): To explore the acceptability of using cannabinoid therapy among former ICU patients, family members, ICU healthcare providers, and administrators. Method(s): A study using Q-methodology is currently in process to elicit the latent opinions of all relevant stakeholders. Q-methodology is frequently used in the process of healthcare implementation as a valid qualitative and quantitative research method for systematic exploration and description of the range of viewpoints about a topic. Our team started by creating a focused research statement and set of subjective statements presented to study subjects (Concourse). Responses to this set of statements were then condensed to a smaller subset (Q-sampling) through critical team discourse. A convenience participant sample (n~30) representing each stakeholder group will be recruited to sort through the Q-sample (Q-sort). Each participant will be asked to rank the statements according to their own subjective opinions. Result(s): Q-factor analysis will identify patterns of subjectivity among responses by calculating the correlation coefficients between Q-sorts to identify common viewpoints. Final results will be available for presentation. Conclusion(s): This study will generate a foundation of knowledge essential to planning feasible, high-quality clinical research evaluating the safety and effectiveness of cannabinoids in this setting.

N2  - Purpose/Objective: To educate Spanish speaking cancer patients/families on cancer pain management and debunking myths about cancer pain. Background/Rationale: Limited Spanish educational materials/ programs on pain management are available. In the US, pain is the most common reason individuals consult with a physician, yet formany - especially theHispanic community - pain is a sensitive topic amongst cancer patients. to educate Spanish speaking patients/families on pain management and debunking myths about cancer pain. Description/Methods/Evaluation: Eighty-four Spanish speaking cancer patients participated in an educational intervention. Pre/post tests were collected, including one month followup calls and focus groups. Education was provided on: types of cancer pain, medication safety, including CAM &non-therapeutic options for pain management. Including dispelling myths/perceptions of cancer pain and taking an active role in their care by communicating their pain. Outcome/Results/Findings: Educational intervention further identified a distorted perception of pain when undergoing cancer treatment: (1) pain was not manageable (2) part of the treatment process (3) a way that the body gets rid of cancer.Others refused medication for fear of addiction. When asked how they dealt with pain, majority preferred to receive support from their families or other cancer patients. Patients shared that they did not communicate their pain issues to their healthcare team, for fear of treatment delay. Conclusion/Discussion: After attending class patients are able to take more active role in their care. They are able to communicate their pain to their health care team by using descriptivewords and/or using the pain scale to rate their pain or describe it. Patients have incorporated non-drug intervention strategies to help them cope with pain (music, meditation). Power of education and knowledge was evident within a span of a 2-hour class, perceptions were quickly dispelled. Patients learned that they could go through their cancer journey pain free. Implications for Nursing: Findings from this study can guide future interventions and education to improve cancer pain perceptions amongst Hispanics and patient engagement in the healthcare process. Data will be used to guide the development of future educational programs for patients/families and to explore innovative ways to deliver pain educational programs and interventions. Understanding gained provides an opportunity to enhance health communication and health education strategies more effectively to benefit patients and families.

N2  - AIM: This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the resilience levels of nurses and qualit of their professional life. BACKGROUND: Nurses' resilience level can affect their professional qualityof life. A higher resilience level enables them to manage stress and overcome challanges more effectively leading to enhanced patient care and satisfaction. Coversly, lower resiliance can lead to burnout, negatievly impacting both the nurses' wellbeing and the quality of service delivered to patients. INTRODUCTION: It is crucial to understand the correlation between the professional life quality and resilience of nurses working in difficult conditions. METHOD(S): This correlational study was conducted between September 2021 and February 2022. A total of 276 nurses were included in the study. Data were collected using the Demographic Data Form consisting of sociodemographic characteristics, the Professional Quality-of-Life Scale, and the Resilience Scale for Adults. RESULT(S): The resilience score was above average, and the professional quality of life was high. Compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue, which are components of professional quality of life, were moderate, and the burnout level was low. A robust positive correlation was observed between resilience and the professional quality of life. The linear regression model showed that choosing the profession unwillingly, dissatisfaction with the unit in which one works, and the level of psychological resilience are independent factors of professional quality of life. CONCLUSION(S): According to the findings, high psychological resilience increases the quality of professional life. Resilience, choosing nursing willingly, and liking the unit in which one works are determinants of professional quality of life. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING POLICY: Enhancing the professional quality of life of nurses has important individual, institutional, and social consequences. Enhancing resilience has the potential to elevate the quality of professional life. Hence, it is important to develop national and international policies and models. Additionally, managers bear significant responsibilities in ensuring a positive work environment. Undoubtedly, having nurses work in units they like, feel happy in, and prefer will increase their professional quality of life and make positive contributions to patient care, the institution, and society.Copyright © 2024 International Council of Nurses.

N2  - AIM: To understand the perceived helpfulness and acceptability of a bespoke psychological therapy service for registered nurses. The service provided a free and confidential specialist mental health service to all healthcare professionals, including nurses and nursing students. DESIGN: An exploratory study using a descriptive qualitative approach. METHOD(S): A purposive sample of 20 registered nurses accessing a bespoke psychological therapy service in Wales participated in audio-recorded semi-structured interviews in January 2022. Transcribed data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULT(S): Four interrelated themes were identified from the data analysis: COVID [SARS-CoV-2] changed things; You're a nurse, you're human; I've got 'me' back; and pretty close to miracle workers. CONCLUSION(S): Participants attempted to live up to an idealized image of a nurse, generating self-stigmatizing beliefs that negatively affected their mental health. The psychological therapy service enabled participants to put their roles into perspective, that is, separate themselves from their role, be vulnerable, and develop confidence and adaptive coping strategies. Participants valued the minimal barriers and ease of access to support. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND/OR PATIENT CARE: The complex relationship between nurse identity and the challenges of the workplace needs to be central to nurse education. Nurses can benefit from rapid access to a timely, confidential, and independent self-referring psychological therapy service. IMPACT: This qualitative study explored the helpfulness and accessibility of psychological support for nurses. The main themes were that COVID changed things; You're a nurse, you're human; I've got 'me' back; and pretty close to miracle workers. The findings will impact how nurses are supported in the United Kingdom and worldwide. REPORTING METHOD: This report adheres to the standards for reporting qualitative research (SRQR). PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public contribution.Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Journal of Advanced Nursing published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - COVID-19 exacerbated burnout and mental health concerns among the healthcare workforce. Due to high work stress, demanding schedules made attuned eating behaviors a particularly challenging aspect of self-care for healthcare workers. This study aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) mobile app for improving well-being among healthcare workers reporting elevated disordered eating during COVID-19. We conducted a mixed methods pre-mid-post single-arm pilot feasibility trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04921228). Deductive content analysis of participants' commentary generated qualitative themes. Linear mixed models were used to examine changes in pre- mid- to post-assessment scores on well-being outcomes. We consented 28 healthcare workers (25/89% female; 23/82% Non-Hispanic White; 22/79% nurses) to use and evaluate an HRVB mobile app. Of these, 25/89% fully enrolled by attending the app and device training; 23/82% were engaged in all elements of the protocol. Thirteen (52%) completed at least 10 min of HRVB on two-thirds or more study days. Most participants (18/75%) reported being likely or extremely likely to continue HRVB. Common barriers to engagement were busy schedules, fatigue, and technology difficulties. However, participants felt that HRVB helped them relax and connect better to their body's signals and experiences. Results suggested preliminary evidence of efficacy for improving interoceptive sensibility, mindful self-care, body appreciation, intuitive eating, stress, resilience, and disordered eating. HRVB has potential as a low-cost adjunct tool for enhancing well-being in healthcare workers through positively connecting to the body, especially during times of increased stress when attuned eating behavior becomes difficult to uphold.Copyright © 2024.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted delivery of health care services worldwide. We examined the impact of the pandemic on clinics participating in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Clinical Resource Hub (CRH) program, rolled out nationally in October 2019, to improve access to care at under-resourced VA clinics or "spoke" sites through telehealth services delivered by regional "hub" sites. Objective(s): To assess whether the CRH program was associated with increased access to primary care, we compared use of primary, emergency, and inpatient care at sites that adopted CRH for primary care (CRH-PC) with sites that did not adopt CRH-PC, pre-post pandemic onset. Design(s): Difference-in-difference and event study analyses, adjusting for site characteristics. Study Cohort: A total of 1050 sites (254 CRH-PC sites; 796 comparison sites), fiscal years (FY) 2019-2021. Intervention(s): CRH Program for Primary Care. Main Measures: Quarterly number of VA visits per site for primary care (across all and by modality, in-person, video, and phone), emergency care, and inpatient care. Result(s): In adjusted analyses, CRH-PC sites, compared with non-CRH-PC sites, had on average 221 additional primary care visits (a volume increase of 3.4% compared to pre-pandemic). By modality, CRH-PC sites had 643 fewer in-person visits post-pandemic (- 14.4%) but 723 and 128 more phone and video visits (+ 39.9% and + 159.5%), respectively. CRH-PC sites, compared with non-CRH-PC sites, had fewer VA ED visits (- 4.2%) and hospital stays (- 5.1%) in VA medical centers. Examining visits per patient, we found that CRH-PC sites had 48 additional telephone primary care visits per 1000 primary care patients (an increase of 9.8%), compared to non-program sites. Conclusion(s): VA's pre-pandemic rollout of a new primary care telehealth program intended to improve access facilitated primary care visits during the pandemic, a period fraught with care disruptions, and limited in-person health care delivery, indicating the potential for the program to offer health system resilience.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Background: There is limited literature on stress management interventions targeting Indian medical undergraduates. With this background, the study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of stress management intervention on perceived stress, coping and burnout amongst first-year medical undergraduates. Method(s): It was a quasi-experimental study assessing the effect of "Comprehensive Stress Management Skill Training Program". This intervention emphasized on self-awareness of early warning signs of stress, adopting a healthy lifestyle, developing assertiveness at work, maintaining work-life balance. The stress reduction techniques mainly consisted of deep breathing exercises, progressive muscular relaxation and visualization. It was delivered by a team of a psychiatrist and a nurse to hundred first year medical undergraduate students. Medical Students Stressor Questionnaire, Brief COPE Questionnaire and Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey were applied for assessment of perceived stress, burn out, and coping, respectively, at baseline, finish of one and three months of intervention. Result(s): Significant improvement was noted in academic stress, interpersonal-related stress, teaching learning-related stress, and total stress scores, emotional exhaustion, and emotion-focused coping at the end of the three months of intervention. Positive feedback about the intervention was given by majority of the students. Conclusion(s): Stress management intervention was found to be feasible and effective in improving stress, coping, and emotional exhaustion in first year medical students.Copyright © 2021

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) emerges as an intricate and persistent pain condition, characterized not solely by widespread musculoskeletal discomfort but also marked by profound fatigue, disruptions in sleep patterns, and a myriad of other symptoms impacting various organs and systems (1). There are many therapies available for fibromyalgia, including pharmacologic therapies, exercise, electrotherapy, psychological therapies, and complementary and alternative treatments (2). Many systematic reviews have reported the outcomes of these therapies for patients with fibromyalgia; indeed, the therapeutic approach to managing patients with FMS is characterized by integrated and multidisciplinary interventions, acknowledging the diverse range of symptoms experienced by patients (3). The treatment of FMS can be divided into four pillars: patient education, fitness, pharmacological/ non pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy. Suggested treatment strategy should take into account not only the latest EULAR recommendations (3) for FMS management but also real-life clinical experience and realistic patient expectations and goals (1). Pharmacological intervention constitutes a pivotal aspect of this approach, recognizing that while it may not be a standalone solution, it can yield satisfactory results for a distinct percentage of patients. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 3 medications to treat FMS: pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran. However, in a survey only 19% reported being very satisfied with their current treatment, whereas 28% were not very satisfied or not at all satisfied; fatigue, joint pain, and concentration difficulties were also not well managed (4), highlighting an unmet need for additional treatments that can adequately treat multiple symptoms of FMS. Among new pharmacological therapeutic options, we should include NMDA antagonists like ketamine, which is a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist, nitrous oxide and NYX-2925, identified as a NMDAR modulator, that has demonstrated promising effects in preclinical studies (5); TNX-102 SL which is a novel, low-dose, sublingual formulation of cyclobenzaprine designed to be taken at bedtime (6). There is mounting evidence supporting cannabis use in chronic pain conditions [53]. An in-depth review has shown that cannabis has proven benefits in treating chronic pain [54]. However, there is only a handful of randomized trials in FM patients, even though cannabis was associated with beneficial effects on some FM symptoms (7-8). Cannabinoids can be synthesized in the laboratory or extracted from dried plant inflorescences, necessitating a careful distinction between the two and critical evaluation of study outcomes regarding these preparations. With the rising global trend of cannabis use in chronic pain emphasizing FM, evidence is being gathered that supports cannabis use among FM patients (9). Naltrexone has garnered attention for its potential in FMS treatment. In particular, a paradoxical analgesic effect was observed with low-dose naltrexone (LDN) (10). Combined therapeutic strategies also benefit from integrating drugs and nutraceuticals. It has been found that the fatty acid amide palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) both have an effect on CWP (11), and one study has investigated the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of PEA in FM patients (12). PEA is an endogenous chemical that is thought to regulate inflammatory analgesic events and tissue reactivity by activating the cell surface cannabinoid (CB) 2-like receptor, the orphan G protein-coupled receptor(GPR)-55, and the nuclear receptor of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family, and down-regulating mast cell degranulation autacoid local inflammation antagonism (ALIA) mechanisms. ALC provides another approach to nociplastic pain therapy (13) as it increases the effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) while acting as an acetyl-group donor, and contributes to mitochondrial energy homeostasis and detoxification. As in the case of other chronic conditions, fitness (14) is pivotal and should involve weight loss, aerobic and strengthening exercises as well as dietary modifications, all of which are important disease-modifying factors. Weight loss improves posture and well-being, and decreases both obesity-induced inflammation and peripheral nociceptive inputs. Aerobic exercise is strongly recommended as it can improve pain and physical function in patients with FMS, although the commencement of training can be difficult for some patients because of deconditioning and psychological factors A recent metaanalysis evaluated the effect of physical exercise-based therapy (PEBT) on pain, impact of the disease, quality of life (QoL) and anxiety in patients with FMS, to determine the effect of different modes of physical exercise-based therapy, and the most effective dose of physical exercise-based therapy for improving each outcome (15). Thus, due to the low compliance of patients to recommendations for physical activity or a healthy lifestyle, physicians trend to medicalize the disease. Psychological therapies (16) (e.g. relaxation, hypnosis, coping skills training, biofeedback, and cognitive behavioural therapy) may help people manage pain and its disabling consequences. Therapies can be delivered faceto- face by a therapist, via the Internet, by telephone call, or by computer programme. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of all types of electrical neuromodulation (17) in patients with fibromyalgia was conducted showing that electrical neuromodulation is significantly effective in treating pain, depression, and functioning in patients with fibromyalgia. In a recent review, the effectiveness of most therapies for fibromyalgia was not supported (4). Strong evidence supported only cognitive behavioral therapy for pain, as well as antidepressants and central nervous system depressants for pain and quality of life, but these associations were small. In light of the multifaceted nature of FMS, a tailored and symptom-driven approach to pharmacotherapy emerges as crucial. Monitoring and prioritizing key symptoms pave the way for integrating various solutions, including nutraceuticals, into the treatment regimen. This comprehensive strategy aims at achieving individualized therapeutic outcome (18-20).

N2  - Speaker: Winfried Hauser is a specialist in general internal medicine, psychosomatic medicine and pain medicine, and author of systematic reviews of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of FMS. His H-index is 71. In my lecture, I refer to the 2017 recommendations of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) for the management of FMS and the 2017 German guidelines on the diagnosis and therapy of FMS and my personal experiences in collaborating with people with FMS since 30 years. If we consider a multidisciplinary approach to FMS, we have to keep in mind that: a) The management of FMS substantially depends of the ressources of the particular health care system and that there are great differences between countries, even in so-called first world countries in the treatment options available for people with FMS. b) As in most other diseases, we can differentiate different severities of FMS (mild, moderate, severe). Guidelines recommend a graduated approach in the management of FMD depending on the severity. Multicomponent or combined therapies are defined by the combination of at least two treatment modalities (exercise, physical therapies / physiotherapy, psychological and pharmacological therapies). We know from patient surveys that most people with FMS use a multicomponent self- management approach. Multicomponent treatment does not necessarily imply a multidisciplinary treatment. A single GP, rheumatologist, psychiatrist or pain specialist can use a combined therapy, e.g. medication and psychological support and advice for aerobic exercise. Thus, mild and some moderate FMS-cases can be managed by a single disciplinary approach. EUALR and the German guidelines recommend the referral to a mental health care specialist in case of anxiety, depression or maladaptive coping (e.g. catastrophizing). In most European countries, many FMS-patients are under a multidisciplinary, yet uncoordinated treatment, e.g. pain treatment by a GP and pain specialist and therapy of mental disorders by a mental health care specialist. Unfortunately, this multidisciplinary treatment is not interdisciplinary, because regular exchange between the disciplines require time and are not reimbursed by health insurance companies. EULAR and the German guidelines recommend multimodal rehabilitation programs for severe cases of FMS defined by high impairment in daily function. Interdisciplinary programmes have to include (a) a common philosophy treatment in line with the biopsychosocial model of pain; (b) a treatment component where patients actively participate by means of tasks, training and/ or exercise; (c) at least three different healthcare professionals from various disciplines that provided the interdisciplinary treatment; (d) a single facility where each patient received treatment. These programs are available and reimbursed by statutory health insurance companies in Scandinavia and Germany. Unfortunately, the evidence for combined and interdisciplinary treatment for FMS is not convincing. There is evidence from systematic reviews of RCTs that combined aerobic exercise with at least one psychological therapy was superior to control groups (waiting list, attention conteol treatment as usual) in reducing pain and disability in the long-run. However, combined aerobic exercise with cognitive behavioral therapies was not superior to aerobic exercise alone in 6 RCTs. A systematic review of cohort studies has shown that participation in an interdisciplinary programme was associated with considerable improvements in wellbeing that were generally maintained at follow-up in patients with chronic primary musculoskeletal pain. However, only a few studies with FMS-patients could be included in the review and no FMS-subgroup analysis was provided.

N2  - Background: Losing a patient by suicide may lead to psychological distress and mid/long-term personal and professional consequences for psychiatrists, becoming second victims. Material(s) and Method(s): The validated Spanish version of the Second Victim Experience and Support Tool (SVEST-E) questionnaire and a 30-item questionnaire created ad-hoc was administered online to psychiatrists from all over Spain to evaluate how patient suicide affects mental health professionals. Result(s): Two hundred ninety-nine psychiatrists participated in the survey, and 256 completed the SVEST-E questionnaire. The results of the SVEST-E questionnaire revealed a negative impact of suicide on emotional and physical domains, although this seemed not to lead to work absenteeism. Most respondents desired peer support from a respected colleague and considered institutional support, although desirable, lacking. Almost 70% of surveyed stated that an employee assistance program providing free counseling to employees outside of work would be desirable. The ad-hoc questionnaire showed that up to 88% of respondents considered some suicides unavoidable, and 76% considered the suicide unexpected. Almost 60% of respondents reported no changes in the approach of patients with suicidal ideation/behavior, after losing a patient. However, up to 76% reported performing more detailed clinical evaluations and notes in the medical record. Up to 13% of respondents considered leaving or changing their job or advancing retirement after losing a patient by suicide. Conclusion(s): After a patient's suicide, psychiatrists often suffer the feelings of second victim, impacting personal and professional areas. The study results indicate the need for postvention strategies to mitigate the negative impact of patient suicide.Copyright © 2023 Sociedad Espanola de Psiquiatria y Salud Mental (SEPSM)

N2  - This study is an attempt to explore war-related trauma, its stressful effects, and the coping strategies of Saudi schoolchildren. The authors hypothesized that children exposed to war-related trauma will show higher levels of PTSD, and that those with higher levels of PTSD symptoms use more maladaptive coping strategies. The study describes the correlation between traumatic events and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as coping strategies. Five hundred twenty-seven intermediate and high school students, 12 to 18 years old, living in the conflict zone in southern Saudi Arabia completed three standardized self-reported scales: the War Zone Traumatic Events Checklist, the Child PTSD Symptom Scale, and the Children's Coping Strategies Checklist. Each participating student was randomly chosen. Analysis was based on two groups: the high-PTSD symptoms group (182 children) and the low-PTSD symptoms group (345 children). The study was conducted between September 2020 and April 2022 while the war was ongoing as part of an ongoing larger study. Children exposed to war-related traumatic events exhibited greater prevalence rates for PTSD. The children reported high levels of PTSD symptoms and applied a variety of coping strategies to manage related stress. Participants rarely reported that psychological or educational interventions had been used to manage the war-related traumatic experiences and PTSD or to improve related coping styles. The results are discussed in the context of mental health services needed for children in the conflict zone. To bridge the gap between health care services and the needs of children with PTSD, and for better understanding and interventions, health professionals are invited to develop a biopsychosocial model that identifies the risks of PTSD related to exposure to war-related traumatic events in school-aged children and, hence, provide a multidisciplinary intervention program that educates, encourages, and supports teachers and parents in following medical recommendations and goals.Copyright © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

N2  - Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still an important issue for scientists because it is difficult to cure with the available molecular medications and conventional treatments. Due to the complex nature of the brain structures and heterogeneous morphological and physiological properties of neuronal cells, interventions for cerebral-related disorders using surgical approaches, and classical and ongoing treatments remain hard for physicians. Furthermore, the development of newly designed medications attempts to target AD are not successful in improving AD, because abnormalities of tau protein, aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, inflammatory responses, etc lead to advanced neurodegeneration processes that conventional treatments cannot stop them. In recent years, novel diagnostic strategies and therapeutic approaches have been developed to identify and cure early pathological events of AD. Accordingly, many gene-based therapies have been developed and introduce the therapeutic potential to prevent and cure AD. On the other hand, genetic investigations and postmortem assessments have detected a large number of factors associated with AD pathology. Also, genetically diverse animal models of AD help us to detect and prioritize novel resilience mechanisms. Hence, gene therapy can be considered an effective and powerful tool to identify and treat human diseases. Ultimately, gene study and gene-based therapy with a critical role in the detection and cure of various human disorders will have a fundamental role in our lives forever. This scientific review paper discusses the present status of different therapeutic strategies, particularly gene-based therapy in treating AD, along with its challenges.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses have faced many professional and ethical dilemmas and challenges along with bearing physical, mental, and emotional stress resulting from worrying about themselves or their family being infected and stigmatized. This stress can potentially lead to burnout and resignation. Professional resilience is crucial for nurses to cope with these adverse situations. This study aimed to investigate the process by which nurses adapt, change, and overcome challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and ultimately demonstrate professional resilience. Method(s): Descriptive phenomenology was applied. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 nurses working in COVID-19 wards and intensive care units to collect data. Giorgi's phenomenological analysis method was employed. Result(s): Based on the interview responses, four major themes were identified: 1) balancing patient care, self-protection, and passing on experience; 2) providing timely pandemic team resources and social support; 3) nurses' perseverance amid social discourse and constrained lives; and 4) selfless dedication shaping nursing's pinnacle experiences. Conclusion(s): In the face of a sudden pandemic, frontline nurses play a critical role in maintaining medical capacity. Consequently, they must balance their families, lives, and work while adapting to the impact of the pandemic and changing practices and procedures based on the development of the pandemic and policy demands. The study findings provide insights into the challenges and emotional experiences encountered by nurses during a sudden pandemic outbreak and can serve as a reference for developing strategies to help nurses overcome these challenges and enhance their professional resilience.Copyright © 2024

N2  - BACKGROUND: Critical care nurses (CCNs) are routinely exposed to highly stressful situations, and at high-risk of suffering from work-related stress and developing burnout. Thus, supporting CCN wellbeing is crucial. One approach for delivering this support is by preparing CCNs for situations they may encounter, drawing on evidence-based techniques to strengthen psychological coping strategies. The current study tailored a Resilience-boosting psychological coaching programme [Reboot] to CCNs. Other healthcare staff receiving Reboot have reported improvements in confidence in coping with stressful clinical events and increased psychological resilience. The current study tailored Reboot for online, remote delivery to CCNs (as it had not previously been delivered to nurses, or in remote format), to (1) assess the feasibility of delivering Reboot remotely, and to (2) provide a preliminary assessment of whether Reboot could increase resilience, confidence in coping with adverse events and burnout. METHOD(S): A single-arm mixed-methods (questionnaires, interviews) before-after feasibility study design was used. Feasibility was measured via demand, recruitment, and retention (recruitment goal: 80 CCNs, retention goal: 70% of recruited CCNs). Potential efficacy was measured via questionnaires at five timepoints; measures included confidence in coping with adverse events (Confidence scale), Resilience (Brief Resilience Scale), depression (PHQ-9) and burnout (Oldenburg-Burnout-Inventory). Intention to leave (current role, nursing more generally) was measured post-intervention. Interviews were analysed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis. RESULT(S): Results suggest that delivering Reboot remotely is feasible and acceptable. Seventy-seven nurses were recruited, 81% of whom completed the 8-week intervention. Thus, the retention rate was over 10% higher than the target. Regarding preliminary efficacy, follow-up measures showed significant increases in resilience, confidence in coping with adverse events and reductions in depression, burnout, and intention to leave. Qualitative analysis suggested that CCNs found the psychological techniques helpful and particularly valued practical exercises that could be translated into everyday practice. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates the feasibility of remote delivery of Reboot and potential efficacy for CCNs. Results are limited due to the single-arm feasibility design; thus, a larger trial with a control group is needed.Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Compassion is critical to the provision of high-quality healthcare and is foregrounded internationally as an issue of contemporary concern. Paid care experience prior to nurse training has been suggested as a potential means of improving compassion, which has been characterised by the values and behaviours of care, compassion, competence, communication, courage, and commitment. There is however a dearth of evidence to support the effectiveness of prior care experience as a means of improving compassion in nursing. OBJECTIVE(S): To explore the impact of paid prior care experience on the values and behaviours of pre-registration nursing students indicated as characterising compassionate care. DESIGN: Longitudinal mixed methods design employing a modified concurrent triangulation strategy, comprising two work packages. Work package 1 was qualitative, and work package 2 adopted a concurrent embedded strategy with a dominant quantitative component. Research is reported in accordance with the Good Reporting of a Mixed Methods Study framework. SETTING(S): Three United Kingdom universities. PARTICIPANTS: Pre-registration nursing students attending one of three universities, and individuals who had previously participated in a Health Education England paid prior care experience pilot. Participant numbers at time point 1 were questionnaires n=220, telephone interviews n=10, and focus groups n=8. METHOD(S): Work package 1 consisted of longitudinal semi-structured telephone interviews. Work package 2 comprised validated online questionnaires measuring emotional intelligence, compassion satisfaction and fatigue, resilience, psychological empowerment, and career commitment (as proxies of compassionate values and behaviours), and focus groups. Qualitative data were thematically analysed. Quantitative data were analysed via Analysis of Variance in SPSS v 26. RESULT(S): Qualitative findings suggest that prior care experience has both positive and negative effects on students' compassionate values and behaviours, however positive effects do not extend to qualification. No statistically significant differences were found in any of the quantitative outcome measures between participants with and without paid prior care experience. A statistically significant increase in compassion fatigue was identified in both groups of participants post-qualification. Paid prior care experience did not prevent participants from experiencing reality shock on becoming a student or on qualification. CONCLUSION(S): There is insufficient evidence of longitudinal beneficial impact to recommend paid prior care experience as an effective intervention to foster nursing students' compassionate values and behaviours. These findings do not support mandating a period of paid care experience as a prerequisite for entry into nurse education. REGISTRATION: N/A.

N2  - AIM: This systematic review aims to assess effectiveness of oral health policies, recommendations and guidelines in safeguarding oral health of children with special healthcare needs during COVID-19. BACKGROUND: This systematic review evaluated the adaptation of global oral health policies for children with special healthcare needs (SHCN) during the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide evidence-based insights to inform policymakers and healthcare providers amid the ongoing global health crisis. The study focused on assessing the effectiveness of these adaptations in ensuring equitable access to quality dental care for this vulnerable group. METHOD(S): A PRISMA guided online search through LILIACS, PubMed, Scopus, COCHRANE and grey literature was conducted. The search strategy incorporated a combination of subject headings (MeSH terms) and free-text terms related to "oral health," "dental health," "policy," "effectiveness," "dental practice guidelines," "oral health policies," and "special care needs children." Eligibility criteria included oral health policies, recommendations and guidelines targeting individuals/children with special care needs. Both qualitative and quantitative studies published in English from 2008 to 2023 were included. RESULT(S): Sixteen guidelines, recommendations and policies, from six authorities were identified. These documentations addressed six different areas mentioned broadly as comprehensive care, ethical considerations, preventive and therapeutic measures, equity, patient-centric treatment, and reducing disparities signaling a paradigm shift. International collaborations and standardization of guidelines indicated a unified approach. The review also emphasized on a commitment to continuous improvement through quality measurement, systematic referral management, and needs assessment. With the exception of two documents, the remaining guidelines did not address COVID-19 or provide specific adaptations for it. The lack of emphasis on individual condition was notable, as the guidelines generally took a more generalized approach toward individuals with special healthcare needs. CONCLUSION(S): In conclusion, this review assessed the impact of COVID-19 on oral healthcare for individuals with special needs. It underscores global and local efforts for equitable access, patient-centric care, and preventive measures. The lessons learned advocate for a resilient, inclusive healthcare framework capable of meeting diverse needs. PROSPERO REGISTRATION: CRD 42023452475.Copyright © 2024.

N2  - Background: Many military Veterans experience mood and anxiety disorders and might benefit from purposeful social interactions. In this pilot study, we evaluated a program in which Veterans with these disorders provided coaching via webcam for English-language learners (ELLs). Method(s): Veterans with depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD and ELLs were recruited online. Pairs participated in up to 8 videoconferencing sessions. Pre-post measures of Veterans' mental health included the PHQ-8, GAD-7, PCL-5, and a scale of "mattering." Volunteers and ELLs completed satisfaction surveys, and ELLs reported their comfort and fluency with English. Result(s): Veterans (N = 26) were on average 49.6 years old (SD: 15.2), 57.7 % were men, and 53.9 % reported that they often experienced a lack of companionship or social isolation. Pairs completed on average 6.2 sessions. Satisfaction in both groups was high, and 73.1 % of participants said that they planned to keep in touch. Mean scores improved for Veterans' symptoms of depression (from 10.6 to 7.6, P=.0001), anxiety (from 9.0 to 6.5, P=.001), and PTSD (from 29.2 to 22.8, P=.0007). The proportion of Veterans with at least moderate symptoms improved for depression (61.5 % to 38.5 %; P=.014) and anxiety (38.5 % to 19.2 %; P=.025). Mattering scores improved (P=.008). ELLs reported improvements in their English comfort and fluency. Limitation(s): This was an uncontrolled pilot trial with short-term outcomes designed primarily to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention rather than test hypotheses about effect sizes. Conclusion(s): This intervention may represent a scalable opportunity for Veterans to increase positive socialization and reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD.Copyright © 2024

N2  - Pandemic-related stressors may disproportionately affect the mental health of people with HIV (PWH). Stratified, purposive sampling was used to recruit 24 PWH who participated in a quantitative survey on COVID-19 experiences for in-depth interviews (IDIs). IDIs were conducted by Zoom, audio recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to develop an adapted stress-coping model. Participants experienced acute stress following exposure events and symptoms compatible with COVID-19. Social isolation and job loss were longer-term stressors. While adaptive coping strategies helped promote mental health, participants who experienced multiple stressors simultaneously often felt overwhelmed and engaged in maladaptive coping behaviors. Healthcare providers were important sources of social support and provided continuity in care and referrals to mental health and social services. Understanding how PWH experienced stressors and coped during the COVID-19 pandemic can help healthcare providers connect with patients during future public health emergencies, address mental health needs and support adaptive coping strategies.Copyright © 2024.

N2  - Objectives: In Toronto, many families with Somali backgrounds have children living with type 1 diabetes (T1D). At our clinic, children with African and Caribbean backgrounds have higher glycated hemoglobin than children from European backgrounds. In this study, we explored the experiences and perspectives of Somali Canadian families with children living with T1D, as well as health-care professionals (HCPs) who care for them, to better understand how T1D impacts these families. Method(s): We conducted 3 separate focus groups with Somali Canadian parents of children with T1D (n=11), Somali Canadian adolescents with T1D (n=5), and HCPs who treat patients with diabetes (n=9), respectively. A grounded theory approach to data analysis was applied to identify themes. Result(s): Four key themes emerged: 1) the general impact of living with diabetes, 2) the challenges of self-management, 3) uncertainty on whose job it is to manage the diabetes, and 4) how cultural differences between Canada and Somalia impact diabetes management. There was discordance in the perspectives of families and HCPs for all themes, but especially themes 1 and 3. Parents focussed on the social impact of diabetes and behavioural indicators of management success, whereas HCPs emphasized clinical measures. Families believed children should take charge of their diabetes self-management early on, whereas HCPs believed the children were not developmentally ready for this responsibility. Conclusion(s): Differing perspectives of patients, families, and HCPs may lead to diverging expectations for treatment and management. Families and practitioners must work together to identify barriers to care and build strategies to promote competency and resilience in the self-management of T1D.Copyright © 2023 Canadian Diabetes Association

N2  - Introduction: Most university students with mental disorders remain untreated. Evaluating the acceptance of intervention targets in mental health treatment, promotion, and prevention, as well as mental health service delivery modes is crucial for reducing potential barriers, increasing healthcare utilization, and efficiently allocating resources in healthcare services. Aim(s): The study aimed to evaluate the acceptance of various intervention targets and delivery modes of mental health care services in German first-year university students. Method(s): In total, 1,376 first-year students from two German universities from the 2017-2018 multi-center cross-sectional cohort of the StudiCare project, the German arm of the World Mental Health International College Student Survey initiative, completed a web-based survey assessing their mental health. Mental disorder status was based on self-reported data fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria. We report frequencies of accepted delivery modes [categories: group or in-person therapy with on or off campus services, self-help internet- or mobile-based intervention (IMI) with or without coaching, or a combination of a in-person and IMI (blended)]. In a multinomial logistic regression, we estimate correlates of the preference for in-person vs. IMI vs. a combination of both modes (blended) modalities. Additionally, we report frequencies of intervention targets (disorder specific: e.g., social phobia, depressive mood; study-related: test anxiety, procrastination; general well-being: sleep quality, resilience) their association with mental disorders and sex, and optimal combinations of treatment targets for each mental illness. Result(s): German university students' acceptance is high for in-person (71%-76%), moderate for internet- and mobile-based (45%-55%), and low for group delivery modes (31%-36%). In-person treatment (72%) was preferred over IMI (19%) and blended modalities (9%). Having a mental disorder [odds ratio (OR): 1.56], believing that digital treatments are effective (OR: 3.2), and showing no intention to use services (OR: 2.8) were associated with a preference for IMI compared to in-person modes. Students with prior treatment experience preferred in-person modes (OR: 0.46). In general, treatment targets acceptance was higher among female students and students with mental disorders. However, this was not true for targets with the highest (i.e., procrastination) and the lowest (i.e., substance-use disorder) acceptance. If only two intervention targets were offered, a combination of study-related targets (i.e., procrastination, stress, time management) would reach 85%-88% of the students. Conclusion(s): In-person services are preferred, yet half of the students consider using IMI, preferably aiming for a combination of at least two study-related intervention targets. Student mental health care services should offer a combination of accepted targets in different delivery modes to maximize service utilization.Copyright 2024 Kahlke, Hasking, Kuchler and Baumeister.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many work-related stresses are experienced by oncologists. Ukraine is currently undergoing numerous crises, including the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and military conflicts, which represent stressful situations. The aim of this study was to explore the personal resources that Ukrainian oncologists use to cope with work demands in a situation featuring manifold crises. This study identified the ways in which people deal with stressful situations and the roles that they play in shaping the challenging situations that they encounter (work-related behavior) as well as how they cope with stress (stress management). METHOD(S): Forty oncologists (18 men and 22 women) working in a clinic in Kharkiv (Ukraine) with an average age of 46.3+/-13.37 years (ranging from 26 to 74 years) participated in this study. The occupational psychological survey consisted of the Work-Related Behavior and Experience Patterns (German: Arbeitsbezogenes Verhaltens- und Erlebensmuster, AVEM) questionnaire, which was developed by Schaarschmidt and Fischer, and the Differential Stress Inventory (DSI), which was developed by Lefevre and Kubinger. RESULT(S): 65% of oncologists exhibited AVEM risk pattern A or B. No gender differences were observed with regard to the distribution of AVEM patterns. Women obtained significantly higher scores than did men on only one dimension: experience of social support (4.86 vs. 3.44; p=0.045). When the DSI categories were differentiated by gender, no significant differences were observed. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed a medium-sized correlation between perfection striving and palliative coping (rho=0.404). CONCLUSION(S): Few gender-based differences in work-related behaviors, experiences, and stress management strategies are evident among oncologists. AVEM risk patterns are more prevalent among Ukrainian oncologists than among comparable occupational groups, and interventions in the context of health management are recommended.Copyright © 2024.

N2  - Nursing burnout has reached a new level of prevalence among professionals and is rising among nursing students and can impact student success in the classroom and clinical areas. Among advanced practice nurses, psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioners have the least favorable combination of low compassion satisfaction and high secondary traumatic stress, placing them at even greater risk for burnout compared to other specialties. Trauma informed teaching and learning principles can serve to prevent burnout and have a positive impact on learning outcomes. Through these teaching methods, nurse educators have the opportunity to both support students during their nursing education and prepare students for the professional stressors that contribute to burnout. This quality improvement project involved implementation and evaluation of a HRSA funded program to train PMHNP students interested in working in rural and underserved areas. The training intervention included didactic curricular enhancements, a trauma resiliency training and a longitudinal clinical practicum. Qualitative program outcomes indicated that trainees were implementing trauma-informed principles and skills with patients and for self-care during their nursing training and at one year follow-up. The program may offer practical upstream solutions for nurse educators and future studies should explore concepts more formally to develop best practice models.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Psychiatric nurses are at a higher risk for exposure to violence and aggression, leading to potential burnout, moral injury, post-traumatic stress, and turnover. There is little evidence of a preferred strategy to support nurses and decrease the impact of traumatic experiences on psychiatric nurses. The aim of this integrative review was to explore potential strategies to decrease the impact of traumatic experiences among nurses in psychiatric settings. METHOD(S): Following a systematic search of PsycINFO/Ovid, CINAHL, and MEDLINE/Pubmed, Joanna Briggs Institute quality appraisal tools were used to analyze quality of the articles. Thirteen articles met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study. Data were analyzed and synthesized into three key themes and seven sub-themes. RESULT(S): Three themes were noted to be common to the included texts. 1. Interpersonal Supports (Formal Support, Peer/Supervisor Support, and Informal Family/Social Support). 2. Organizational Supports (Perception of Job Safety/Satisfaction, Promoting Personal Resilience, Supporting Team Resilience, and Organizational Commitment to Resilience). 3. Protection of Personal Resources. CONCLUSION(S): Many common suggestions for decreasing the impact of exposure to violence and trauma were noted across the thirteen articles, however, there is little evidence of a preferred strategy, how strategies are developed and employed or the efficacy of any particular strategy. Further investigation is needed to identify and evaluate supportive interventions, their feasibility and efficacy.

N2  - Objective: This study aimed to explore the effects of a mHealth-based relaxation program on anxiety and stress coping levels in mothers of children with cancer. Method(s): This randomized controlled, single-blind, parallel-group trial was conducted in the pediatric hematology-oncology unit of a university hospital. The study was completed by 50 mothers (intervention group: n = 25; control group: n = 25). The mothers in the intervention group participated in a mHealth-based relaxation program for eight weeks (including progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and the four-leaf clover of mindfulness). Videos of the relaxation program were sent to mothers' WhatsApp accounts. The mothers in the control group received routine care. The State-Trait Anxiety and Stress Coping Scales were administered during the first and eighth weeks. The registration number of this study on ClinicalTrials.gov is NCT05807295. Result(s): Mothers who participated in the relaxation program had lower anxiety levels and higher stress-coping scores than those in the control group (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Progressive muscle relaxation exercises, guided imagery, and cognitive-based therapeutic approaches were effective in reducing mothers' anxiety and stress coping. Practice implications: Pediatric oncology nurses can apply mHealth-based relaxation programs to support caregivers, particularly mothers. In this way, ensuring the continuity and integrity of care is easy.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Introduction: South Africa has one of the highest rates of internal migration on the continent, largely comprised of men seeking labour in urban centres. South African men who move within the country (internal migrants) are at higher risk than non-migrant men of acquiring HIV yet are less likely to test or use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, little is known about the mechanisms that link internal migration and challenges engaging in HIV services. Method(s): We recruited 30 internal migrant men (born outside Gauteng Province) during August 2022 for in-depth qualitative interviews at two sites in Johannesburg (Gauteng) where migrants may gather, a factories workplace and a homeless shelter. Interviewers used open-ended questions, based in the Theory of Triadic Influence, to explore experiences and challenges with HIV testing and/or PrEP. A mixed deductive inductive content analytic approach was used to review data and explain why participants may or may not use these services. Result(s): Migrant men come to Johannesburg to find work, but unreliable income, daily stress and time constraints limit their availability to seek health services. While awareness of HIV testing is high, the fear of a positive diagnosis often overshadows the benefits. In addition, many men lack knowledge about the opportunity for PrEP should they test negative, though they express interest in the medication after learning about it. Additionally, these men struggle with adjusting to urban life, lack of social support and fear of potential stigma. Finally, the necessity to prioritize work combined with long wait times at clinics further restricts their access to HIV services. Despite these challenges, Johannesburg also presents opportunities for HIV services for migrant men, such as greater anonymity and availability of HIV information and services in the city as compared to their rural homes of origin. Conclusion(s): Bringing HIV services to migrant men at community sites may ease the burden of accessing these services. Including PrEP counselling and services alongside HIV testing may further encourage men to test, particularly if integrated into counselling for livelihood and coping strategies, as well as support for navigating health services in Johannesburg.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

N2  - AIM: To evaluate the mediating roles of occupational resilience and the moderationg role of perceived organizational support in the relationship between career calling and nurse burnout. BACKGROUND: Burnout is a frequent and serious problem in the field of nursing, and it poses a serious threat to both nurses' health and patient safety. Although many studies have described the links between burnout, career calling, and occupational resilience, little is known about the actual mechanisms between career calling and nurse burnout. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study of 615 nurses in China was conducted using a convenience sampling method. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation analysis. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation models and bootstrapping methods. STROBE guidelines were followed. RESULT(S): Career calling was found to be negatively associated with nurse burnout, and occupational resilience mediated the relationship between career calling and burnout. Additionally, perceived organizational support was found to play a moderating role in the relationship between occupational resilience and burnout. CONCLUSION(S): Career calling can reduce burnout by increasing nurses' levels of occupational resilience, and perceived organizational support moderates this mechanism. Hence, policies focused on encouraging and sustaining career calling should be provided by nurse managers in order to enhance stress resistance and reduce burnout.Copyright © 2024 International Council of Nurses.

N2  - Critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) is a commonly utilized intervention in the fire service that aims to minimize psychological harm and adverse mental health outcomes after a potentially traumatic incident. This study aimed to explore firefighter preferences regarding CISD and alternative post-critical incident interventions in relation to firefighter coping self-efficacy (FFCSE) and trauma coping self-efficacy (CSE-T). Firefighters (N = 241) completed an online survey and provided complete data. Most participants were White (n = 203, 84.2%), non-Hispanic (n = 221, 91.7%) men (94.2%; n = 227). CISD was the most preferred intervention among firefighters (n = 113, 46.9%) as compared to informal peer support (n = 31, 12.9%), formal one-on-one counseling (n = 29, 12.0%), and no intervention (n = 68, 28.2%). Firefighters who preferred CISD had statistically significant lower levels of FFCSE, R2 = .033-.044, ps = .012-.030, and CSE-T, R2 = .035-.061 ps = .017-.024, compared to those who preferred no intervention. Firefighters who preferred formal one-on-one counseling had statistically significantly lower levels of FFCSE, R2 = .033-.044, ps = .003-.011, and CSE-T, R2 = .035-0.061, p < .001-p = .002, compared to those who preferred no intervention. The findings from this study may guide future research to increase knowledge on firefighter intervention preferences and the association between preference and coping self-efficacy.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The resilience education of intern nursing students has significant implications for the development and improvement of the nursing workforce. The clinical internship period is a critical time for enhancing resilience. AIMS: To evaluate the resilience level of Chinese nursing interns and explore the effects of factors affecting resilience early in their careers, focusing on the mediating roles of career adaptability between clinical learning environment and resilience. METHOD(S): The cross-sectional study design was adopted. From March 2022 to May 2023, 512 nursing interns in tertiary care hospitals were surveyed online with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Clinical Learning Environment Scale for Nurse and the Career Adapt-Abilities Scale. Structural equation modelling was used to clarify the relationships among these factors. Indirect effects were tested using bootstrapped confidence intervals. RESULT(S): The nursing interns showed a moderately high level of resilience [M (SD)=70.15 (19.90)]. Gender, scholastic attainment, scholarship, career adaptability and clinical learning environment were influencing factors of nursing interns' resilience. Male interns with good academic performance showed higher levels of resilience. Career adaptability and clinical learning environment positively and directly affected their resilience level (beta=0.62, 0.18, respectively, p<.01). Career adaptability was also positively affected by the clinical learning environment (beta=0.36, p<.01), and mediated the effect of clinical learning environment on resilience (beta=0.22, p<.01). CONCLUSION(S): Clinical learning environment can positively affect the resilience level of nursing interns. Career adaptability can affect resilience directly and also play a mediating role between clinical learning environment and resilience. Thus, promotion of career adaptability and clinical teaching environment should be the potential strategies for nursing interns to improve their resilience, especially for female nursing interns with low academic performance.Copyright © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SUBJECT?: Psychotic symptoms and depression are common problems in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. Psychological flexibility is a skill that facilitates coping with difficulties. There is limited research on the role of psychological flexibility in the relationship between psychotic symptoms and depression in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. WHAT DOES THE ARTICLE ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This article investigates the role of psychological flexibility in the link between psychotic symptom severity and depression in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. The article shows that psychological flexibility partially mediates the relationship between psychotic symptom severity and depression. The article suggests that interventions aimed at improving psychological flexibility may be beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Mental health nurses should consider psychotic symptom severity and psychological flexibility when assessing and intervening for depressive symptoms in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. Mental health nurses should receive training to improve psychological flexibility and pass this skill on to their patients. Mental health nurses should continue to research the effectiveness and outcomes of interventions aimed at improving psychological flexibility. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Psychological flexibility may help people diagnosed with schizophrenia (PWS) cope with their psychotic symptoms and reduce their depressive symptoms, but the mechanism of this effect is unclear. AIM: To investigate whether psychological flexibility mediates the relationship between psychotic symptom severity and depression in PWS. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study was conducted, in which a total of 111 PWS were assessed with DSM-5 Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity, Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia and Acceptance and Action Questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 25 and PROCESS macro. RESULT(S): Significant correlations were found between psychotic symptoms, depression and psychological flexibility. Psychological flexibility partially mediated the relationship between psychotic symptom severity and depression. DISCUSSION: Psychological flexibility could weaken the impact of psychotic symptom severity on depression in PWS. Higher psychotic symptoms were associated with lower psychological flexibility and higher depression. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Interventions to improve psychological flexibility may prevent depressive symptoms in PWS. Psychiatric nurses can use psychological flexibility as a goal for evaluation and intervention.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

T1  - YOGA AS A NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION IN DISEASES
A1  - Shankaregowda A. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - A paradigm change in healthcare has occurred recently, with an emphasis on investigating non-pharmacological interventions as supplements to traditional medical treatments. Of them, yoga has become one of the most effective and adaptable tools for managing a wide range of illnesses and fostering holistic well-being. Yoga, which has its roots in ancient India, is more than simply physical exercise; it's a holistic approach to well-being that incorporates breathing exercises pranayama, physical postures asanas, mindfulness exercises, and meditation. Yoga's ability to address the interdependence of mind, body, and spirit makes it a viable non-pharmacological intervention for managing disease. By taking a holistic approach, yoga aims to address underlying imbalances that lead to disease in addition to symptom relief. Because of its potential to enhance conventional medical treatments and promote general well-being, yoga has drawn the interest of researchers, patients, and healthcare professionals alike. Yoga's appeal is due to its profound effects on mental and emotional health in addition to its physical advantages. Studies have indicated that yoga can improve mood, resilience, and general quality of life while lowering stress, anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, yoga's focus on self-awareness and mindfulness encourages a closer relationship between the person and their inner experience, empowering them to manage health issues on their ownCopyright © 2024, Codon Publications.

N2  - Adolescent competence and resilience are indicators of adulthood behavior. High school is a pivotal time for adolescents to foster a stable temperament for adult development. The contemporary state of adolescent depression prevalence and an increase in social media-related risky behavior calls for an update to mental health services. We review the nature of modern social comparison that is fueled by social media, mental health help-seeking stigma that prevents individuals from seeking services, and provide mental health advances to remedy the severity of mental health concerns in a social media society. Social media distortions of normative life promote a standard of expectations that can decrease self-esteem and increase depressive tendencies. Expanding high school counseling such that students see a counselor multiple times a year in a proactive rather than reactive school counseling system can provide transformative changes to community mental health.

N2  - Health professional educators routinely utilize simulation to prepare students for practice. However, there is little evidence to show whether simulation enhances learning for genetic counseling students. This study aimed to (i) develop simulation learning outcomes and standardized clients for genetic counselor student education and (ii) evaluate students' experiences of learning from face-to-face and virtual simulation in the first week of training in an Australasian master of genetic counseling program. Using the principles of co-design, eight experienced genetic counselors from across Australasia attended an online discussion and one-to-one meetings to develop simulation learning outcomes and build detailed authentic standardized clients. Six learning outcomes were identified: establishing an effective counseling relationship, eliciting information, assessing need, delivering difficult news and helping clients cope with complex emotions, effective communication and facilitating adaptation. Standardized clients were mapped to the learning outcomes and other requirements of the program. Between 2019 and 2022, 106 first year students participated in face-to-face or virtual simulation workshops with two standardized clients on Day 5 of their training. Following the experience, 103 students completed an anonymous survey using a modified version of a validated satisfaction with simulation scale (n=49 face-to-face in 2019 and 2020 and n=54 virtual in 2021 and 2022). Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Mean satisfaction overall was 95.9% (SD 3.5), 96.2 (SD 4.0) face-to-face, and 95.8 (SD 3.7) virtual. Overall, responses indicated that simulation-based learning and working with standardized clients was a valuable learning experience (100%), developed communication skills and created a sense of reality (99%). For a minority of participants (n=4), the simulation was too challenging. Key learning related to consolidation of counseling skills, reflective practice, and preparation for clinical placement. In conclusion, exposing novice student genetic counselors to authentic clinical scenarios using standardized clients in face-to-face or virtual classrooms enhanced clinical learning.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted essential health services, including those provided by national neglected tropical disease (NTD) programs. Most mass drug administration (MDA) programs were postponed for 6-12 months following World Health Organization guidance released in April 2020 to temporarily halt NTD programs and launch necessary COVID-19 precautions. While NTD-endemic countries have since resumed MDA activities, it is critical to understand implementers' perspectives on the key challenges and opportunities for program relaunch, as these insights are critical for maximizing gains towards disease control and elimination during public health emergencies. Using data from using online surveys and focus group discussions, this mixed-methods study sought perspectives from Ministry of Health NTD Program Managers and implementing partners from non-governmental organi-zations working in sub-Saharan Africa. Data analysis revealed that findings converged around several main themes: disruptions for MDA programs included resource shortages due to prioritization of pandemic response, challenges adhering to COVID-19 safety proto-cols, and community hesitancy due to coronavirus transmission fears. Identified solutions for restarting MDA programs focused on adapting intervention delivery and packaging to minimize disease transmission, embracing technology to optimize intervention planning and delivery, and identifying opportunities to promote program integration between pandemic response strategies and NTD campaign delivery. Findings identifies key challenges due to disruptions to NTD program delivery and provide strategic recommendations for endemic countries to build resilient programs that can continue to perform during and beyond global pandemics.Copyright © 2023 Itaye et al.

N2  - Purpose:The purpose of this study was to determine if a mindfulness-based smartphone application, used for 5 minutes a day for 30 days, could address burnout among acute care nursing staff. Method(s): A pretest-posttest design with a midpoint evaluation was utilized. The sample included 31 nursing staff from cardiovascular acute care units. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised, Perceived Stress Scale, and Brief Resilience Scale were used to measure the impact of the intervention on participants. Finding(s): In a repeated measures analysis, there were no statistically significant changes in scores on the Brief Resilience Scale across the three timeframes (F=0.64, df=1.42, p=.49). There were significant reductions over time for perceived stress (F=10.56, df=1.74, p=.002) and personal burnout (F=11.8, df=1.10, p=.007), and increased scores on mindfulness (F=4.76, df=1.57, p=.039). Conclusion(s): The utilization of a mindfulness-based smartphone application may promote the health and well-being of cardiovascular nurses in acute care units. Mindfulness-based smartphone apps should be considered as a method of self-care, along with other holistic approaches to improve well-being.

N2  - Schools are an important setting for the early identification, assessment and intervention of mental health problems in children and young people. Internationally, many nurses work in schools, but the role of this group with young people experiencing mental health problems has had only limited investigation. This study explored the activities school nurses undertook with young people experiencing mental health problems in Australia. Reporting was guided by the COREQ checklist. Thirty-one nurses participated in a semi-structured interview. Data were analysed using the constant comparative method of analysis as developed by Glaser and Strauss (1967). The findings identified that nurses working in schools undertake a complex and sophisticated workload to support this cohort. In addition to assessment and referral for treatment, interventions assisted young people to manage challenging life circumstances, cope with intensely difficult emotions and improve their social and occupational functioning. The work of school nurses with young people experiencing mental health problems is hidden and unacknowledged. A better understanding of the mental health work school nurses undertake can inform enhanced service provision for children, young people and their families. The research findings will be of interest to mental health nurses, education professionals, parents, policy makers and governments.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - AIM: This study aims to determine the effects of nurses' perceived workplace incivility on nurses' presenteeism and turnover intention and to reveal the mediating role of work stress and psychological resilience in the possible impact. BACKGROUND: Nurses directly contribute to the treatment of patients. The problems nurses encounter in the workplace can negatively affect nurses' attitudes towards work. Therefore, the problems faced by nurses should be determined. METHOD(S): This study complies with the STROBE checklist. This cross-sectional survey was conducted with 302 nurses working in a university hospital in the Konya province of Turkey. Data were collected in May-July 2021. The questionnaire consisted of six parts: sociodemographic characteristics form, workplace incivility scale, psychological resilience scale, work stress scale, turnover intention scale and presenteeism scale. The data were analysed using descriptive statistical methods and partial least-squares path analysis. RESULT(S): It was determined that workplace incivility positively and significantly affected turnover intention, presenteeism and work stress. In contrast, it negatively and significantly affected psychological resilience. In addition, psychological resilience played a mediating role in the effect of workplace incivility on presenteeism. CONCLUSION(S): The results reveal that the behaviours of incivility encountered by nurses in the workplace increase their presenteeism and turnover intention, and work stress further strengthens these effects. The psychological resilience of nurses is a factor that can help them eliminate their negative emotions and attitudes. Therefore, it is recommended that nursing and health managers first identify the stress factors in the workplace and be determined to fight them. In addition, organizing training and providing psychological support to increase nurses' psychological resilience may enable nurses to develop more positive feelings about their jobs and workplaces. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Nursing and health managers must determine workplace incivility behaviours and inform all employees about these behaviours, their consequences and how to deal with such incivility. In addition, nursing and health managers must determine the stress factors in the workplace and be adamant about combating these factors. In addition, nursing and health managers must give importance to training that will increase the psychological resilience of nurses.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

N2  - Purpose: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused patients to suffer from various physical and psychological symptoms and social challenges, but the impact was harder for those COVID-19 patients receiving treatment in single-room isolation wards in South Korea. This study aimed to investigate resilience, anxiety, depression, and sleep quality of those patients and the relationships between those variables, and explore the patients' experience of resilience during the COVID-19 treatment in single-room isolation wards. Method(s): This study employed a mixed-methods approach, collecting quantitative data through surveys and qualitative data through semistructured interviews conducted between May and October 2022. Quantitative surveys encompassing disease-specific and demographic information, visual analog scales to assess anxiety, depression, and sleep quality, and the Connor-Davidson resilience scale were administered to patients (N = 153). Qualitative thematic analyses were conducted following interviews with a subset of patients (N = 13) belonging to the high-resilience group. Result(s): Resilience exhibited a negative correlation with anxiety and depression, while showing a positive correlation with sleep quality. Factors affecting resilience include having a spouse, educational attainment, and depression. The qualitative thematic analysis results were categorized into: (1) facing the reality of being isolated in a room; (2) struggling to accept and adapt to isolation; and (3) seeking connections in isolation. Conclusion(s): This research sheds light on the challenges faced by individuals in isolation and underscores the crucial role of resilience in overcoming such challenges. The resilience observed in these patients is grounded in both interpersonal and profound spiritual connections. These findings underscore the necessity for nurses to develop customized strategies to alleviate the impacts of social isolation.Copyright © 2024

N2  - Background: Positive mental health (PMH) is a construct used to define and evaluate health from a positive perspective. Healthcare professionals in the emergency ambulance service are more likely to experience mental health disorders than the overall population. The demographic and occupational variables and Sense of Coherence (SOC) can act as predictors of PMH and can serve as protective elements against stress and demanding situations in the work environment. Objective(s): This study aimed to evaluate PMH and its relationship with demographic and occupational variables and determine if SOC is a predictive variable for PMH in health professionals working in the emergency ambulance service. Method(s): A descriptive, cross-sectional, and correlational study was conducted with a sample of 406 healthcare professionals from the emergency ambulance service in eight health regions of Catalonia, Spain. The following variables were analyzed: Age, biological sex, household members, dependents family members, professional category, type of contract, job satisfaction and sense of collaboration with other institutions. The following assessment instruments were used: Positive Mental Health Questionnaire and Sense of Coherence scale. Result(s): High scores were obtained in Positive Mental Health (PMH). Study participants who reported feeling completely satisfied in their work also showed a significant relationship with all PMH factors: greater satisfaction with their personal life, in their helpful prosocial attitude toward others, in their capability to deal effectively with stress and navigate conflict scenarios, in their ability to solve problems and self-realization, greater empathy and ability to understand the feelings of others, greater ability to establish interpersonal relationships. Comprehensibility, as a dimension of SOC, was identified as a predictor for some factors of PMH: a greater personal satisfaction, self-control, autonomy, interpersonal skills and total PMHQ. More than 43% of positive mental health in health professionals is explained by higher Meaningfulness and Comprehensibility values of the SOC, the absence of dependent family members and having a non-graduate background. Conclusion(s): Healthcare workers in the emergency ambulance service had high PMH. Meaningfulness (ME) and Comprehensibility (C), dimensions of SOC, were identified as model predictors of greater PMH, showing higher scores in most of PMH factors. To enhance SOC as a mental health promotion measure, resilience programs should be implemented to help professionals develop skills to face and overcome adverse situations. Educating in stress management thought networks are key elements to strengthen SOC. Managers in emergency medical services play a key role in transforming healthcare work environments to promote positive outcomes in the mental health of their healthcare workers.Copyright © 2024 Mantas-Jimenez, Reig-Garcia, Roqueta-Vall-Llosera, Camara-Liebana, Masia-Plana, Lluch-Canut and Juvinya-Canal.
