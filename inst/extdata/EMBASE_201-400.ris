N2  - It is important to understand the differential impact of COVID-19 on the health of older lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual, and people with other sexual orientations and forms of gender expression (LGBTQIA+). The objective of this study is to systematically review the impact of COVID-19 on LGBTQIA+ older adults' health including risk and protective factors. We reviewed a total of 167 records including LGBTQIA+ older adults published since 2019. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and extracted information of 21 full-text records meeting inclusion criteria using COVIDENCE software. The results show that the negative health consequences are exacerbated by personal risk (e.g., perceived homo/transphobia and ageism in LGBTQIA+ communities) and environmental factors (e.g., heterosexism within health services). The negative impact seems to be reduced by personal protective (e.g., resilience, spirituality, and hobbies) and environmental factors (e.g., technology use to increase social participation and social rituals). In conclusion, the health of LGBTQIA+ older adults has been disproportionately affected during the pandemic associated to the latest coronavirus (COVID-19). The experiences of LGBTQIA+ older adults during the pandemic are integrated in a Model of Health and Disease for LGBTQIA+ older adults. Specific strategies to promote health and well-being in this community are provided.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess impact of participation in a positive psychology coaching program on trainee burnout and well-being. BACKGROUND: Coaching using principles of positive psychology can improve well-being and reduce physician burnout. We hypothesized that participation in a coaching program would improve pediatric surgery trainee well-being. METHOD(S): With IRB approval, a coaching program was implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic (9/2020-7/2021) in the American Pediatric Surgical Association. Volunteer pediatric surgery trainees (n=43) were randomized to receive either one-on-one quarterly virtual coaching (n=22) from a pediatric surgeon trained in coaching skills or wellness reading materials (n=21). Participants completed pre- and post-study surveys containing validated measures including PERMA (positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, accomplishment), professional fulfillment, burnout, self-valuation, gratitude, coping skills, and workplace experiences. Results were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum test, Kruskal-Wallis test, or chi-square test. RESULT(S): Forty trainees (93%) completed both the baseline and year-end surveys and were included in the analysis. Twenty-five (64%) were female, mean age 35.7 (SD 2.3), 65% first-year fellows. Coached trainees showed an improved change in PERMA (P=0.034), burnout (P=0.024), and gratitude (P=0.03) scores from pre- to post-coaching compared to non-coached trainees. Coping skills also improved. More coaching sessions was associated with higher self-valuation scores (P=0.042), and more opportunities to reflect was associated with improved burnout and self-valuation. CONCLUSION(S): Despite the stress and challenges of medicine during COVID-19, a virtual positive psychology coaching program provided benefit in well-being and burnout to pediatric surgery trainees. Coaching should be integrated into existing wellness programs to support acquisition of coping skills that help trainees cope with the stressors they will face during their careers.Copyright Â© 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Evidence on effective prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is sparse, particularly among first responders. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a Tactical Mind-Body Resilience Training program on PTSD symptoms in first responders. METHOD(S): Active-duty first responders (n = 80; Mage = 41.8 years, 82.5% men) were randomized to the intervention group or the waitlist control condition. PTSD symptoms as measured by the PTSD-8 were the primary outcome assessed at postintervention and at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were cognitive and emotional coping strategies, resilience, somatic symptoms, work performance, and sickness absence. RESULT(S): At postintervention, the intervention group had significantly reduced PTSD symptoms compared to the control group (d = -0.26, difference = -2.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-4.93, -0.11], p = .040); however, this difference was attenuated at 3-month follow-up (d = -0.07, difference = -1.41, 95% CI [-3.83, 1.01], p = .248). The intervention group had significant improvements in cognitive reappraisal and resilience at postintervention compared to the control group, which were sustained at 3 months. The remaining secondary outcomes had statistically nonsignificant improvements. CONCLUSION(S): This workplace-delivered intervention shows potential in preventing the development of PTSD in first responders. Further research is needed on maintaining long-term benefits of this training. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Chronically ill adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients experience barriers to accessing psychosocial support/palliative care, increasing their risk for negative psychosocial outcomes. Online health communities (OHCs) have been recommended for AYAs as part of palliative care support programs; however, we lack research investigating palliative care programs targeting AYAs' psychosocial support needs that are delivered virtually and able to engage with patients both during and beyond inpatient admissions. Streetlight is a palliative care program designed for chronically ill AYAs. Developed as a complementary component that extends beyond the hospital setting, Streetlight Gaming and Online Team (SGOT) is an OHC aimed at facilitating social support to influence psychosocial outcomes. We investigated the existence and enactment of social support among chronically ill AYAs using SGOT and compared this to existing online social support categories to determine which support types are present within SGOT. METHOD(S): This was a qualitative phenomenological study. We performed deductive thematic analysis based on existing online social support categories. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with SGOT participants. RESULT(S): Social companionship/belonging, esteem/emotional, and informational support were most prevalent within SGOT. Thirteen subthemes emerged representing how social support impacted AYAs' psychosocial wellbeing. Notably, coping with/managing illness, sense of community and normalcy, recommendations and advice, and shared interests unrelated to illnesses were subthemes that resonated with AYAs and added value to their experiences. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: SGOT is an impactful OHC used to meet AYAs' social support needs. What makes SGOT especially unique is its virtual delivery, wherein AYAs can conveniently maintain beneficial relationships with other chronically ill same-aged peers. AYAs need spaces where they can feel normal and access continuous support, both within and beyond inpatient admissions. This study enhances our understanding of online AYA psychosocial support programs. Findings can be used by healthcare professionals to implement similar palliative care and psychosocial support programs.

T1  - A vision to enhance self-regulation in children: The promise of pediatric hypnosis
A1  - Lombard L. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Pediatric hypnosis practices are a valuable tool for enhancing emotional self-regulation and promoting resilience. Hypnotically informed materials, toys, and language are simple ways to encourage relaxation and stress management. By learning hypnosis skills such as becoming imaginatively absorbed in imagery, "belly breathing," and using simple toys to promote muscle relaxation, children can access natural and novel ways to navigate life's challenges. An example of these hypnotically informed materials and skills training exercises can be found in Comfort Kits (developed by Dr. Karen Olness circa 1996 and widely distributed by Drs. Culbert and Olness since 2004, used by thousands of children in hospitals and in community settings following natural disasters and wars. Extending this supportive tool and self-hypnosis training into schools presents an opportunity to introduce children to self-directed stress management skills in a practical and convenient manner. Training children to use hypnotically informed self-regulation skills begins to fill the gap between the need for mental health services and available resources. By incorporating hypnotically informed stress management training and self-hypnosis practices into schools, we can equip children with essential tools for improved mental well-being, particularly when they need psychological first aid. Using hypnotic practices and skills can help children manage difficult experiences and develop a sense of comfort and control. Next steps include looking at the feasibility and efficacy of positioning self-directed self-regulation practices (like those found in Comfort Kits and used by clinicians trained in therapeutic pediatric hypnosis) in schools, including through consultation with experts in curriculum development and assessment.

T1  - The rape of babies, tracking of cases and treatment
T3  - Le viol des bebes, reperage et prise en charge
A1  - Romano H.
A1  - Hayez J.-Y. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - If sexual violence perpetrated against children currently seems to be better recognized and treated, there is one type of act and one age category that are totally disregarded: babies and very young children, many of pre-verbal age, (0-3 years) who are victims of rape. However there are adults (and even minors) who are regularly convicted of being perpetrators. Our professional experience has led us for years to treat very young children who are victims of rape without the specificity of this violence being discussed in scientific articles. There is a real taboo concerning the rape of babies, and this unspeakable act leads the interveners to not even imagine that such an act can exist and, therefore, not to consider its reality, even though the resulting disorders are obvious. Admittedly, this is extreme abuse, given the vulnerability of the victims. It is nevertheless very real and the absence of publications on this subject can only make us wonder, because it probably results in a resounding silence about many situations. Perpetrators who rape a baby might kill the child as a result of the acts committed [1], they can continue to abuse the child even when they grow up, but they may also stop the abuse as soon as the child becomes able to speak for fear of being reported. As no quantitative study has ever been carried out on this subject, we can only transmit the reality of the field based on our work as psychotherapists and experts. When a very young child is subjected to rape that is not detected, and when he or she survives, and that violence stops when they begin to speak, it does not mean that the violence suffered will not be expressed in other ways, especially by violence against oneself or others. Rape leaves physical and psychological ramifications and it is often inappropriate sexual behavior that will alert adults (relatives, teachers). But the young child does not have sufficient memory capacity to remember what they have experienced and suffered, and they are unable to denounce their aggressor. Since the expressiveness of post-traumatic stress disorder is not linear, it is common that the child's attitude will be noticed by adults only years after the assaults have been committed. And the consequences of rape suffered in early childhood can be innumerable (multiple post-traumatic disorders, disorders in the construction of childhood sexuality, learning disorders, disorders in the establishment of social bonds, etc.). At a time of full psychosexual, psychoaffective and cognitive development, this extreme violence can have a lasting effect on the child's future. Furthermore, the fact that externalized disorders (which are clearly visible and worrying) can appear on a delayed basis remains largely unknown, including by professionals. This can be a source of all kinds of misunderstandings, particularly due to the lack of training of those involved who believe that if the disorders manifest themselves it is because the abuse has just been committed and they are convinced that the child is able to name the perpetrator. Children who have been raped as a baby do not have this ability to defend themselves when they are assaulted and to denounce their perpetrator at the time when the abuse took place. It is therefore essential to identify these situations as early as possible in order to limit the effects of such violence. The main objective of this article is to describe the specificity of rape committed on toddlers in order to better identify the signs likely to alert health professionals to the reality of this type of violence to which very young children are submitted so that the earliest possible treatment can be undertaken. The audience of our publication is that of babies and children under the age of three, that is, an age group where the child's dependence on an adult is very strong, and the capacity for verbal expression is nil or very limited. The memory of recent events is still in the child's infancy and is best expressed by a behavior of interpretation that is not always obvious. This article is informed by our clinical experience and qualitative data collected throughout our years of experience. This work has allowed us to conduct an analysis of these different criteria, and to propose, through a synthetic table, fundamental elements of identification when working with very young children. If the rapes suffered by very young children result in obvious marks on the child's body, they are also at the origin of invisible psychological suffering that can result in disorders endangering not only the child (dangerous behavior, addictions, suicide attempts, suicide), but can also effect his or her entourage (sexual violence, physical aggression). The conclusion of this reflection is the necessity of recognizing the importance of training stakeholders to step away from the frequent denial of the reality of this violence. Daring to talk about this subject in order to reverse this unspeakable clinical situation, makes it possible to envisage appropriate care and to reduce the number of child victims who remain alone in their suffering, with all the concurrent dangerous consequences that this can entail.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - Health professional competency building is one of nine national responsibilities (to achieve universal coverage and sustainability) described in the 2018 World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) implementation guidance for the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI). With stagnating rates of exclusive breastfeeding worldwide, skilled breastfeeding support as a standard of newborn care is critical to the establishment of lactation and exclusive breastfeeding. Few studies exist on how low-income countries are integrating BFHI into their standards of care. This qualitative case study describes Malawi's experience. We interviewed 48 key informants and conducted a desk review of the literature on BFHI programming, national plans, policies and other related documents. We explored the findings using the seven key domains and 16 competencies to implement the Ten Steps to successful breastfeeding from the WHO and UNICEF Competency Verification Toolkit. The study found that although the focus of the guidance is on preservice training, continuing education and in-service training remain important. To achieve universal coverage for health professional competency, Malawi uses preservice, in-service and refresher training. However, their main limitations to aligning with the new guidance are a lack of preservice BFHI- and breastfeeding-specific curricula, experienced lecturers and sufficient time to dedicate to practical skill development. Conducted during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, this study confirmed disruptions to BFHI training and service delivery, while also documenting Malawi's resilient attempts to mitigate impacts on breastfeeding support through mentoring and coaching. Opportunities exist for strengthening and scaling up, including engaging preservice training institutions and standardizing mentoring, coaching and competency verification.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Background: People who support Veterans as they transition from their military service into civilian life may be at an increased risk of psychological distress. Existing studies focus primarily on paid family caregivers, but few studies include spouses and informal non-family "care partners." We sought to identify key challenges faced by care partners of Veterans with invisible injuries. Method(s): Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 36 individuals involved in supporting a recently separated US military Veteran enrolled in a 2-year longitudinal study. CPs completed validated measures on perceived stress, caregiving burden, quality of their relationship, life satisfaction, and flourishing. Independent t-tests were used to compare cases in these groups on caregiving burden, quality of their relationship, life satisfaction, and flourishing. Care partners were categorized as reporting high and low levels of stress. Exemplar cases were used to demonstrate divergences in the experiences of CPs with different levels of stress over time. Result(s): Care partners reported shifts in self-perception that occurred from supporting a Veteran, emphasizing how they helped Veterans navigate health systems and the processes of disclosing health and personal information in civilian contexts. Exemplar cases with high and low burdens demonstrated divergent experiences in self-perception, managing multi-faceted strain, and coping with stress over time. Case studies of specific care partners illustrate how multi-faceted strain shifted over time and is affected by additional burdens from childcare, financial responsibilities, or lack of education on mental health issues. Conclusion(s): Findings suggest the unique needs of individuals who support military Veterans with invisible injuries, highlighting variations and diachronic elements of caregiving. This sample is younger than the typical caregiver sample with implications for how best to support unpaid care partners caring for Veterans in the early to mid-period of their use of VA and civilian health services.Copyright Â© 2024 Rattray, Flanagan, Mann, Danson, Do, Natividad, Spontak and True.

N2  - This article focused on the experiences of women who underwent medical termination of their pregnancies. The study adopted a qualitative phenomenological research design with a sample of 20 pregnant women. Data were collected between April and June 2022 using a personal information form and a semistructured individual interview. The qualitative data were analyzed into 4 categories: "psychosocial impacts," "impacts on functionality," "coping," and "expectations." These categories comprised 8 themes and 24 subthemes. Nurses play a crucial role in adopting family-centered approaches to offer holistic care. They should prioritize providing physical care throughout the medical termination, while also assessing the psychological impact of fetal loss. Perinatal palliative care and bereavement counseling should be integrated into care practices.Copyright Â© 2024 by The Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - Aim: This study aimed to determine if participation in a preceptorship programme affected newly hired experienced professional nurses' self-efficacy in clinical practice and whether their perceived competence was related to respondents' demographic profiles at a university hospital in Saudi Arabia. Background(s): Formal preceptorship programmes are initiated with the aim of improving the characteristics related to new workplace adaptations, such as reducing stress and anxiety, improving effective communication, enhancing clinical performance and competencies, and learning new clinical skills. These programmes' effectiveness in improving nurses' self-efficacy in clinical practice is seldom measured, especially among newly hired experienced professional nurses. Method(s): A quasi-experimental, quantitative pre- and post-test one-group study design with convenient sampling was used. Result(s): Self-efficacy post-test scores were significantly higher than pre-test scores (p<0.001). The programme positively influenced the respondents' self-efficacy scores. As perceived by the respondents, the preceptorship programme had a positive effect and improved their clinical performance in the nursing process. There was no relationship between perceived competence and respondents' demographic profiles. Conclusion(s): Reporting on self-efficacy in clinical practice may not be the most effective, reliable or accurate measure or evaluation of clinical performance since self-scoring may be affected by existing cultural implications and a strong sense of self-efficacy. The self-scoring results may be followed by qualitative information, like interviews, to determine respondents' knowledge of the nursing process, direct observation of performance in the clinical area and care outcomes, and confirm if the respondents' clinical performance matches the obtained results.Copyright Â© 2024 The Author(s)

N2  - This narrative literature review aims to articulate the interests and issues in investigating the potential links between the mental health of police officers and the use of force they may deploy during the course of their interventions. The first two sections delineate the definitions of the core concepts of police psychological health and the use of force, as well as their specific issues. The third addresses the issues underlying the study of potential relationships between these two fields. Due to the nature of their profession, police officers are at increased risk of developing mental health problems, which can be clinically significant and lead to several conditions known as common mental disorders (e.g., depression, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, burnout, substance abuse, suicidal ideation). Their etiology among police officers is related to three main risk factors: organizational, operational, and individual. Organizational and operational factors are considered to have a direct impact on the development of common mental disorders, while individual factors are more indirect. They are mostly related to the ability to manage stress or reinforce the effect of direct factors. While there is a voluminous amount of literature on the topic of risk factors relating to post-traumatic stress or burnout, there is a lack of evidence concerning depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, or substance abuse among police officers. The mental health of police officers can have consequences on the missions they must carry out, including those involving the use of force. This concept is still relatively complex to define as it depends on both the legal framework and the policies and management practices within the police institution. The most widely accepted use-of-force theoretical model is the force continuum articulating escalation versus de-escalation of force and the degree of the officer's force and the offender's resistance. The identification of risk factors influencing the use of force is currently based on a non-consensual literature, although the key domains are relatively well established: officer, offender, encounter, and community characteristics. However, there is still little consensus as to the characteristics that constitute these domains, particularly regarding community, organizational, and individual characteristics. Only a few studies focus on the link between burnout and use of force. In this context, the intersection between organizational and work psychology and forensic psychology is of great interest, particularly in the development of a structured, empirical approach based on the modeling of risk factors.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder is an important psychological problem affecting the physical mental health of Chinese healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim(s): To estimate the prevalence and influencing factors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Chinese healthcare workers during COVID-19. Method(s): Search of Chinese and English literature in PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, Medline, Elsevier, SpringerLink, China Biomedical Literature Database, CNKI, Wan-fang, and CQVIP for the period from December 2019 to August 2023. Stata 14.0 software was used for data analysis. The methodological quality of each study was scored, and data were extracted from the published reports. Pooled prevalence was estimated using the Random-effects model. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger's test and Begg's test. Result(s): Twenty-one studies included 11841 Chinese healthcare workers in this review. First, the overall prevalence of Post-traumatic stress disorder among Chinese healthcare workers during the COVID-19 epidemic was 29.2% (95% CI: 20.7% to 33.7%). Twelve factors included in the meta-analysis were found to be protective against PTSD among Chinese healthcare workers: female, nurse, married, front-line work, less work experience, family or friend diagnosed with COVID-19, history of chronic disease and fear of COVID-19. Conversely, outside Hubei, higher education, social support and psychological resilience are protective factors. Conclusion(s): These recent findings increase our understanding of the psychological status of Chinese healthcare workers and encourage that long-term monitoring and long-term interventions should be implemented to improve the mental health of Chinese healthcare workers in the aftermath of the COVID-19.Copyright Â© 2024 Zhang, Bo, Wang, Fan, Kong, Zhou and Zhang.

N2  - HIV incidence remains alarmingly high among female sex workers (FSWs) in Uganda, necessitating targeted interventions. This study aimed to identify individual and provider-level barriers and facilitators to primary HIV prevention among FSWs in an urban setting. Focus groups involving FSWs and healthcare providers (HCPs) were conducted to inform the development of tailored prevention interventions. Results revealed that all participants had mobile phones, recent sexual activity, and a history of HIV testing, with high rates of sexually transmitted infections and varying HIV test results. FSWs displayed a well-informed awareness of HIV transmission risks, emphasizing the threat for those not testing positive. They unanimously recognized the crucial role of HIV testing in informing, mitigating risks, promoting ART use, and endorsing consistent condom usage. Despite heightened awareness, HCPs noted potential underestimation of vulnerability. Various challenges, including inadequate condom usage, substance abuse, and client dynamics, underscored the complexity of safeguarding against HIV transmission among FSWs. Widespread alcohol and drug use, including marijuana, kuber, and khat, served as coping mechanisms and social facilitators. Some FSWs successfully reduced alcohol intake, highlighting challenges in addressing substance use. FSWs preferred group discussions in health education programs, emphasizing peer interactions and the effectiveness of visual aids in HIV prevention education. This study provides comprehensive insights to guide the development of targeted interventions addressing the multi-faceted challenges FSWs face in HIV prevention.Copyright Â© 2024 by the authors.

N2  - Digital technologies present unrivaled opportunities to improve healthcare services worldwide. Medical devices and hospitals are now using innovative techniques to diagnose cancer patients. Despite the vast amount of data generated, stored, and communicated to the cloud and edge devices, patient data privacy remains a crucial concern. Federated learning (FL) is a revolutionary distributed learning method with significant potential in medical data processing. However, data privacy, data quality, and model performance issues can make it challenging to develop a resilient model. As a solution to the above-mentioned challenges, a secure and collaborative FedCSCD-GAN framework is proposed for clinical cancer diagnosis under the federated learning and GAN optimization principle. By leveraging the collective intelligence of distributed data sources, this framework seeks to improve cancer diagnosis accuracy while maintaining appropriate security measures for sensitive patient data. In the proposed system, the quasi-identifiers (QIden) are identified as independent QIden attributes in health data, while the others are classified as confidential information (CI). Consequently, to enhance security and privacy f- differential privacy anonymization is performed on the QIden attributes, and the resulting data is mixed with the CI attribute. Using anonymized data, the Cramer GAN was trained using Cramer distance for efficiency, and privacy was assessed. Notably, the suggested architecture obtains diagnosis accuracy of 97.80 % for lung cancer, 96.95 % for prostate cancer, and 97 % for breast cancer. Based on the experimental analysis, the proposed architecture detects cancer accurately and addresses security and collaboration issues. This paradigm has the potential to transform healthcare and improve patient outcomes globally.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Residential schools are commonly used in India to provide education for Indigenous youth, which requires young people to stay for long periods at distance from their families and communities. Internationally, there is clear evidence for the deleterious effects of residential schools on the mental health and social and community outcomes of Indigenous children, however little is known about the Indian Indigenous experience. This study examined the impact of residential schooling on Indigenous children's wellbeing and that of their communities, using data from an ethnographic research project in Attapadi, Kerala, including interviews, focus group discussions and participant observation with Indigenous communities. Key outcomes from residential schooling reported by the participants include the fear of losing Indigenous identity, shame of being Indigenous, change in the attitude of young people when they returned from schools, and feelings of confusion and stress that young Indigenous participants felt trying to fit into their communities on their return. Findings suggest that these Indigenous youth felt disconnected from several factors that are known to promote resilience for Indigenous communities including a strong cultural identity, connection to the land and ancestors, thereby making them more vulnerable to poor mental health and negative impacts on their overall wellbeing. Addressing these concerns requires a detailed understanding of the specific factors influencing outcomes for Indigenous youth within the Indian residential schooling system, and designing and implementing data-informed conceptual, structural and policy change including the provision of culturally safe mental health services.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Gender-based violence (GBV) has long-term devastating effects on psychological health, resulting in depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder. Beyond physical and mental health symptoms, GBV can affect survivors on many personal, social, and spiritual levels, impacting their ability to connect to themselves, others, and the world around them. While most research on recovery following GBV has focused on recognizing factors associated with distress or adverse outcomes, there is limited information about how they recover. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: We know little about the internal characteristics that enable or support the healing journey (factors) or what the survivors do to build capacity or support for health and change (strategies). Therefore, this study discovered the main factors or strategies that GBV survivors used throughout their recovery process which included; social connection, self-care, self-understanding and spiritual connection. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Mental health nurses always encounter and deal with the GBV survivors as they always suffer from mental health issues related to their trauma. Therefore, mental health nurses can utilize our research findings to establish nursing interventions or psychoeducational programs with the aim of facilitating trauma recovery among the survivors. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a severe worldwide phenomenon mainly affecting women. Little studies focus on the details of the recovery process that survivors of GBV go through. AIM: To identify the enabling factors that facilitate recovery among survivors of GBV. METHOD(S): We used the thematic qualitative analysis approach to analyse 20 interviews with the women survivors of GBV. RESULT(S): Our study resulted in four factors that survivors used in their recovery process (social connection, self-care, self-understanding and spiritual connection). DISCUSSION: Recovering from an abusive relationship is a social, spiritual, cultural and psychological process. Current study confirmed the positive impact of our identified enabling factors in the recovery process of GBV survivors. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The current study illustrates findings that provide a deeper understanding of the journey to recovery following GBV, which can be helpful when guiding and supporting women who have suffered GBV to start and pursue their journey toward recovery.Copyright Â© 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial negative psychosocial impact due to both the outbreak and the global response to it. As we know from previous health crises, front-line workers are among the risk groups for developing serious mental health problems. As a result of the continuous exposure to highly stressful circumstances, directly in their jobs and indirectly through media consumption and related societal pressures, healthcare professionals are at increased risk for distress, compassion fatigue, burnout and emotional disorders. Recent studies have been revealing specific stressors faced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak, such as limited resources, work overload, fear of infecting significant others and isolation/loneliness. However, research has shown heterogeneity in adaptation to adversities, with many individuals being able to bounce back. Based on this growing evidence, this article provides a clinical working framework to empower healthcare professionals, by critically discussing resilience-promoting strategies along the intra- and interpersonal dimensions of control, coherence and connectedness.Copyright Â© The Author(s), 2023.

N2  - Background: The complexity of US healthcare has been increasing for many years, requiring clinicians and learners to understand care delivery systems in addition to clinical sciences. Thus, there has been a major push to educate faculty and trainees on healthcare functionality. This comes as hospitals expand into health systems requiring the help of more sophisticated expertise of departments such as operations excellence when problem-solving. As a medical student with a background in operations excellence, medical education leader and clinical administration leader all currently facilitating this transition, we wanted to reflect on the barriers we have experienced in clinical implementation of quality improvement projects and educating learners on the impact of operations excellence principles in their clinical education. Method(s): The ideas presented in this article were the result of a several collaborative discussion between the authors, on the key challenges to adopting operations excellence principles into health system science education. In an effort to add context to this reflection through the current body of research present, they supplemented a literature review on the topic which included 86 studies published between 2013 and 2021 regarding health systems science and healthcare leadership engagement in the USA. The themes that intersected between the literature review and the discussions were then expanded on in this paper. Result(s): Through this process, we identified four challenges: (1) the difference in thinking styles, which we term, 'mental model differences'; (2) the strategic nature of process improvement projects and how that collides with physician priorities, or 'the chess game of stakeholder engagement'; (3) the language and precise methodology, or 'consistency of language and need for administrative resilience' and (4) the issue of teaching these concepts or bridging the learning gap.' Conclusion(s): In an increasingly complex healthcare landscape, physicians and trainee's need to bridge gaps between the mental models of administrative and clinical workflow.

N2  - Purpose: Learned helplessness (LH) is the psychological state in which an individual experiences multiple failures and setbacks and experiences a sense of loss when facing the current situation. It is a significant burden for lung cancer patients that can impair quality of life and lead to physical, social, and psychological difficulties. Thus, this study aimed to determine the level of LH among patients with lung cancer and identify factors associated with LH. Patients and Methods: From August 2022 to March 2023, 237 patients with lung cancer from Chongqing University Cancer Hospital were selected for this study. A general information questionnaire, the LH scale, the Brief Illness Perception questionnaire, the Strategies Used by People to Promote Health questionnaire, the Medical Coping Modes questionnaire, and the Self-esteem scale were used for the investigation. Multiple linear regression was employed to identify influencing factors for LH in patients with lung cancer. Result(s): The total LH score of patients with lung cancer was 52.19+/-11.20. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that illness perception (beta=0.249, P=0.001), self-efficacy (beta=-0.194, P=0.017), and resignation coping mode (beta=0.267, P<0.001) were the main influencing factors of LH (P<0.05), which explained 42.0% of the total variance. Conclusion(s): The score of LH in patients with lung cancer was at a moderate level in this study. Illness perception, self-efficacy, and resignation coping mode have been found to impact LH among patients with lung cancer. Healthcare professionals should implement effective interventions, such as promoting self-efficacy, encouraging positive coping, and reducing illness perception, to alleviate LH.Copyright Â© 2024 Huang et al.

N2  - Strengthening primary health care (PHC) is the most cost-effective approach in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to achieve sustainable universal health coverage (UHC), protect against health shocks, and promote health and wellbeing for all people. It has been 45years since PHC was put on the global agenda followed by multiple efforts to advocate for more funding and improved performance of PHC. Yet, investment in PHC is still insufficient and overall performance of PHC systems is weak in LMICs, resulting in increased vulnerability and poor health outcomes especially among marginalized populations. As countries recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposed the fragility of PHC platforms, it is imperative to go beyond advocacy for PHC investments and make systemic changes to strengthen PHC as the foundation of resilient and equitable health systems. We propose five gamechangers to facilitate structural changes for strengthening PHC through a focused health systems approach: (i) integration of client-centered health services at PHC level; (ii) digitization of PHC services; (iii) efficiency gains invested in essential health services; (iv) strengthening management practices for PHC at district and facility levels; and (v) advancing community engagement for PHC. To be successful, the implementation of the gamechangers must be contextualized and focus on achieving sustainable health outcomes, and therefore use implementation approaches that link essential health services to health outcomes. Through this way countries will maximize the possibility of achieving UHC and attaining the ambitious health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.Copyright Â© 2024 Alegre, Sharma, Cleghorn and Avila.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Given the importance of health to educational outcomes, and education to concurrent and future health, cross-systems approaches, such as the Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC) framework, seek to enhance services typically in K-12 settings. A major gap exists in cross-systems links with early care and education serving children birth to age 5. Both pediatric health systems and early family and child support programs, such as Early Head Start (EHS) and Head Start (HS), seek to promote and optimize the health and wellbeing of infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and their families. Despite shared goals, both EHS/HS and pediatric health providers often experience challenges in reaching and serving the children most in need, and in addressing existing disparities and inequities in services. This paper focuses on infant/toddler services because high-quality services in the earliest years yield large and lasting developmental impacts. Stronger partnerships among pedicatric health systems and EHS programs serving infants and toddlers could better facilitate the health and wellbeing of young children and enhance family strengths and resilience through increased, more intentional collaboration. Specific strategies recommended include strengthening training and professional development across service platforms to increase shared knowledge and terminology, increasing access to screening and services, strengthening infrastructure and shared information, enhancing integration of services, acknowledging and disrupting racism, and accessing available funding and resources. Recommendations, including research-based examples, are offered to prompt innovations best fitting community needs and resources.Copyright Â© 2024 Horm, Brophy-Herb and Peterson.

N2  - BACKGROUND: At an individual level, physician resilience protects against burnout and against its known negative effects on individual physicians, patient safety, and quality of care. However, it remains uncertain whether physician resilience also correlates with maintaining a high level of healthcare quality during crises such as a pandemic. This study aimed to investigate whether higher resilience among physicians, who had received training in resilience-related competences in the past, would be associated with higher quality of care delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): This study enrolled physicians working in family medicine, psychiatry, internal medicine, and other medical specialties, who had obtained at least one of three consecutive diplomas in psychosomatic medicine in the past. Participants completed a quantitative and qualitative anonymous online survey. Resilience was measured using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and healthcare quality was assessed through single-item quality indicators, including perceived quality of care, professional autonomy, adequate time for patient care, and job satisfaction. RESULT(S): The study included 229 physicians (70 males/159 females) with additional training in psychosomatic medicine, working in family medicine (42.5%), psychiatry (28.1%), internal medicine (7.0%), or other medical specialties (22.4%). Participants represented four intensity levels of training background (level 1 to level 4: 9.2%, 32.3%, 46.3%, and 12.2% of participants). Training background in psychosomatic medicine was positively associated with resilience (B=0.08, SE=0.04, p<.05). Resilience and training background independently predicted perceived quality of care, even after controlling for variables such as own health concerns, involvement in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, financial strain, percentage of working hours spent on patient care, age, and gender (resilience: B=0.33, SE=0.12, p<.01; training background: B=0.17, SE=0.07, p<.05). Both resilience and training background predicted job satisfaction (resilience: B=0.42, SE=0.12, p<.001; training background: B=0.18, SE=0.07, p<.05), while resilience alone predicted professional autonomy (B=0.27, SE=0.12, p<.05). In response to an open question about their resources, resilient physicians more frequently reported applying conscious resilient skills/emotion regulation (p<.05) and personal coping strategies (p<.01) compared to less resilient medical doctors. CONCLUSION(S): Physician resilience appears to play a significant role in the perceived quality of patient care, professional autonomy, and job satisfaction during healthcare crises.Copyright Â© 2024.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite previous experience with epidemics, African healthcare systems were inadequately prepared and substantially impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Limited information about the level of COVID-19 preparedness of healthcare facilities in Africa hampers policy decision-making to fight future outbreaks in the region, while maintaining essential healthcare services running. METHOD(S): Between May-November 2020, we performed a survey study with SafeCare4Covid - a free digital self-assessment application - to evaluate the COVID-19 preparedness of healthcare facilities in Africa following World Health Organization guidelines. The tool assessed (i) COVID-19-related capabilities with 31 questions; and (ii) availability of essential medical supplies with a 23-supplies checklist. Tailored quality improvement plans were provided after assessments. Information about facilities' location, type, and ownership was also collected. RESULT(S): Four hundred seventy-one facilities in 11 African countries completed the capability assessment; 412 also completed the supplies checklist. The average capability score on a scale of 0-100 (n=471) was 58.0 (interquartile range 40.0-76.0), and the average supplies score (n=412) was 61.6 (39.0-83.0). Both scores were significantly lower in rural (capability score, mean 53.6 [95%CI:50.3-57.0]/supplies score, 59.1 [55.5-62.8]) versus urban facilities (capability score, 65.2 [61.7-68.7]/supplies score, 70.7 [67.2-74.1]) (P<0.0001 for both comparisons). Likewise, lower scores were found for public versus private clinics, and for primary healthcare centres versus hospitals. Guidelines for triage and isolation, clinical management of COVID-19, staff mental support, and contact tracing forms were largely missing. Handwashing stations were partially equipped in 33% of facilities. The most missing medical supply was COVID-19 specimen collection material (71%), while 43% of facilities did not have N95/FFP2 respirators and 19% lacked medical masks. CONCLUSION(S): A large proportion of public and private African facilities providing basic healthcare in rural areas, lacked fundamental COVID-19-related capabilities and life-saving personal protective equipment. Decentralization of epidemic preparedness efforts in these settings is warranted to protect healthcare workers and patients alike in future epidemics. Digital tools are of great value to timely measure and improve epidemic preparedness of healthcare facilities, inform decision-making, create a more stakeholder-broad approach and increase health-system resilience for future disease outbreaks.Copyright Â© 2024.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although it is known that religion is used to cope with health problems, there is a lack of information about the effect of religion on menopausal symptoms and cancer screening attitudes of climacteric women. AIM: This study was conducted to determine the relationship between the religious attitudes of women in the climacteric period and their attitudes toward menopausal symptoms and cancer screening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 381 women in the climacteric period in the Central Anatolia region of Turkiye. Data collection form, the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), OK-Religious Attitude Scale (ORAS), and attitude for cancer screening (short form) (ASCS) were used to collect data. Correlation analysis assessed the relationship between MRS, ORAS, and ASCS. RESULT(S): There was a low positive correlation between women's ORAS mean score (35.19 +/- 4.80) and MRS mean score (12.68 +/- 7.24) (r = 0.284, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant relationship between the mean ORAS scores of the women and the mean ASCS scores (64.59 +/- 10.47) (r = 0.089, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Women who experienced more severe menopausal symptoms had stronger religious attitudes. Women's religious attitudes did not affect their attitudes toward cancer screening. It is therefore recommended that health professionals organize counseling and training activities to protect and improve the health of menopausal women and increase their participation in screening and treatment programs.Copyright Â© 2024 Copyright: Â© 2024 Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to examine the experiences of nurses who provide care to individuals in earthquake-affected areas of eastern Turkey. DESIGN: A phenomenological design from qualitative research methods was utilized in this study. METHOD(S): The study was conducted between May 29, 2023, and August 15, 2023, with 11 nurses working in the western region of Turkey's provinces through one-on-one semi-structured interviews. The interviews were conducted online and recorded on video. Content analysis was performed using the MAXQDA software package. FINDINGS: Themes and sub-themes were identified from the expressions of nurses in line with research findings. Accordingly, 5 themes were determined for nurses providing care to individuals in the earthquake. zone: "challenges they face,""emotions they felt,""coping methods,""knowledge and skills"and "effects of earthquake". CONCLUSION(S): The results obtained from this study demonstrated that nurses experienced difficulties due to environmental (hygiene, cold weather, shelter) and work-related (lack of coordination, psychosocial issues) conditions during the earthquake event. While providing care to individuals in earthquake-affected areas of eastern Turkey, nurses reported feelings of sadness, inadequacy, anxiety, and fear. They employed coping methods such as talking to family/friends, attempting not to dwell on thoughts, and turning to religious practices to manage these negative emotions. Nurses emphasized the necessity of having professional knowledge and crisis management skills to care for individuals during the earthquake period. In accordance with the findings of the research, it is recommended that nurses are provided with realistic training through simulations and drills in disaster management, as well as psychological support interventions.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Since the start of the Global War on Terrorism, exponential demands have been put on military personnel, their families, and the military health care system. In response to a Department of Defense Task Force on Mental Health, the U.S. military began developing and fielding programs to promote the psychological health of its personnel. As part of these initiatives, the Navy and Marine Corps developed the Stress Continuum model. The Stress Continuum is a stress classification system ("ready," "reacting," "injured," and "ill") that provides a common language for identifying, engaging, and intervening when stress reactions or stress injuries are present in military personnel. It is the foundation for resilience and prevention efforts across the Navy and Marine Corps. Although the Stress Continuum has strong face validity, is consistent with current theory, and has been agreed up by expert consensus, it has yet to be empirically validated. The goal of the current article is to begin to empirically validate the Stress Continuum using validated measures of psychological stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of Stress Continuum data (n=2,049) collected as part of a program evaluation of two Navy operational stress control programs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and analyses were conducted to determine the classification quality of the Stress Continuum using a validated measure of stress (a brief version of the Perceived Stress Scale [PSS-4]). RESULT(S): For the first ROC curve, we used the "ill" category (vs. the other three categories) to identify the cut point on the PSS-4. PSS-4 cut point values of 9 and 10, respectively, maximized sensitivity and 1-specificity values. Using the chi-square test, we further found that a more accurate prediction for those in the "ill" category was using the cut point of 9 (79%) relative to 10 (71.8%). For the second and the third ROC curves, we used the "ill" and "injured" categories (vs. the other two categories) and "ill," "injured," and "reacting" categories (vs. the "ready" category), respectively. No optimal cut points on the PSS-4 were identified for these models, indicating that the PSS-4 could not reliably differentiate true-positive and false-positive rates. CONCLUSION(S): We found that the "ill" category of the Stress Continuum was predictive of higher levels of stress on the validated measure of perceived stress. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that the individuals in the "ill" zone likely warrant some type of intervention by a trained professional. FUTURE RESEARCH: The Navy has recently leveraged the Stress Continuum to create the Stress-o-Meter to support the fundamental principles of early recognition, peer intervention, and connection to services at the unit level. The Stress-o-Meter serves as a prevention tool that has the capability to collect information about stress levels throughout the entire unit at any time. Continued work on validating the Stress Continuum model and making it easily accessible to military units will ensure service members get the support they need and leaders are able to address the psychological health of their units.Copyright Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2023.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Successful employment is a functional outcome of high importance for veterans after military discharge. There is a significant rising concern regarding exposure to military sexual trauma (MST) and related mental health outcomes that can impair functional outcomes, such as employment. Although resilience training is a key component of preparing for military service, to date the impact of resilience on employment outcomes for veterans with exposure to MST has yet to be examined. We sought to examine the relationship between resilience and employment in a national sample of post-9/11 veterans with and without MST exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A national survey was conducted between October 2021 and January 2022 to respond to the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act mandate to identify factors affecting post-9/11 women veteran's unemployment. Of veterans, 1,185 completed the survey. Of these, 565 (47.6%) were post-9/11 veterans. The survey collected data on demographics and employment; MST, adult sexual trauma (AST, outside of military), and childhood sexual trauma (CST) exposure; resilience (Response to Stressful Experiences Scale); Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL-5); and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2). Multivariable logistic regression models identified gender-specific associations of resilience with employment among those exposed and not exposed to MST, adjusting for AST, CST, PTSD, and depression. Significance was set at P<.05. RESULT(S): Of 322 women and 243 men post-9/11 veterans, 86.5% were employed. MST exposure (MST[+]) was reported by 31.4% (n=101) of women and 16.9% (n=41) of men. MST(+) women veterans were more likely to report CST (35.6% vs. 14.5%; P<.001), AST (68.3% vs. 17.2%; P<.001), and both CST and AST (19.8% vs. 7.2%; P<.001) than MST(-) women. MST(+) men were more likely to report AST (65.9% vs. 7.9%; P<.001), and both CST and AST (14.6% vs. 1.0%; P<.001) than MST(-) men. Levels of self-reported resilience were similar for MST(+) women and men and their MST(-) counterparts (women: 11.1 vs. 11.0; men: 11.5 vs. 12.0). For MST(+) women, each unit increase in resilience was associated with a 36% increase in odds of employment (OR: 1.36, 95% CI, 1.08-1.71); resilience was not associated with increased odds of employment among MST(-) women. Among MST(+) men veterans, each unit increase in resilience was associated with an 83% increase in odds of employment (aOR: 1.83, 95% CI, 1.13-2.98), and like women veterans, resilience was not associated with employment among MST(-) men. CONCLUSION(S): Among MST(+) women and men post-9/11 veterans, higher resilience was associated with increased odds of employment, whereas resilience was not associated with employment in MST(-) veterans. These findings suggest that resiliency during and after military service is a key component for potentially improving long-term outcomes. Improving resilience using evidence-based approaches among post-9/11 veterans exposed to MST may be an important avenue for increasing successful functional outcomes such as employment. Moreover, MST(+) women and men veterans may benefit from trauma-informed care as a substantial proportion of these individuals also report exposure to CST, AST, PTSD, and depression.Copyright Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2023.

N2  - AIM: To study the relation between burnout and resilience and to identify the profile of nurses presenting this quality. BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION: Healthcare professionals are subject to high rates of burnout. Resilience could be an important factor in preventing or alleviating this condition. METHOD(S): The PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus and ScienceDirect databases were consulted in February 2022 using the equation 'burnout AND resilience AND nurs*'. The inclusion criteria applied were that the texts should describe quantitative studies, be published in English or Spanish, in any year, and be directly related to the question considered. The meta-analysis was performed using StatsDirect statistical software. RESULT(S): Analysis of the 29 studies shows that among the dimensions of burnout, nurses are especially prone to emotional exhaustion, and are less affected by depersonalisation and low personal accomplishment. Those who score highly for resilience tend to have longer service experience, acceptable salaries and less work overload. Meta-analysis reveals an inverse correlation between resilience and burnout (r = -0.41; n = 2750), exhaustion (r = -0.27; n = 6966) and depersonalisation (r = -0.23; n = 6115). CONCLUSION(S): Many nurses present low levels of resilience and suffer from burnout syndrome. The application of programmes to enhance their resilience would help prevent burnout and optimise the potential to provide quality health care. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Resilience is inversely correlated with burnout, depersonalisation and emotional exhaustion. Accordingly, healthcare organisations should develop and implement evidence-based programmes to foster nurses' resilience and thus reduce their susceptibility to burnout.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors.

N2  - This is a bibliometric analysis of the most-cited articles on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the objective of identifying citation patterns for researchers, journals, centers, periods, topics, and nations. A search was conducted in Thomson Reuters' WoS Core Collection employing the expression TI = (posttraumatic stress disorder OR post-traumatic stress disorder OR PTSD). The 100 most-cited articles were downloaded, and the relevant data were extracted and analyzed. These studies had a total of 69,649 citations, ranging from a minimum of 360 to a maximum of 6029 citations, with an average of 696.49, a standard deviation of 720.92, mode of 369, and a median of 512. Eighty-eight percent of the most-cited articles on PTSD originated from the USA, with just six cities accounting for 52% of the publications and the Boston area alone responsible for almost one-fifth of the total output. The universities of Yale and Harvard headed the ranking of institutions with larger numbers of highly-cited articles. Female researchers represented 42.3% of all authors, 51% of the first authors, and 48% of the corresponding authors. The proportion of M.D. authors decreased significantly between the 1980-1999 (42%) and the 2000-2019 (27.2%) periods while that of Ph.D. authors increased from 44% to 57.4%. The most studied population was military veterans (28%). Female victims of sexual or physical violence, traumatized children, and adult survivors of childhood abuse were assessed in only 6-7% of the most-cited publications. Ten clinical trials evaluated psychological interventions but only three investigated pharmacotherapy. We concluded that influential research on PTSD remains centralized in the USA. A balanced gender representation in publications was found. There was a heavy reliance on combat veterans as the study population. Few highly-cited studies on the pharmacotherapy for PTSD were identified. Focused efforts are needed to address these challenges.

T1  - Management of CAR T-cell therapy in pediatrics - nursing recommendations for inpatient care
T3  - 36. Deutscher Krebskongress Fortschritt Gemeinsam Gestalten. Berlin Germany.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Background: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR T-cell therapy) is a potentially curative immunotherapy for pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL. However, life-threatening adverse events may occur. Accurate nursing assessment leads to early recognition of adverse events and may prevent the occurrence of complications. The aim of this literature review is to provide evidence-based recommendations in the management of CAR T-cell therapy for nurses. The research question is: How can CAR T-cell therapy at a pediatric stem cell transplant ward be designed in an evidence-based manner from a nursing perspective? Methods: A literature search of 12 databases was conducted. The results were considered with the inclusion of the nursing process. Result(s): Six publications were included. Seven nursing recommendations for the treatment of pediatric patients were derived from the results. The focus is on education, database assessment, Lymphodepleting conditioning, CAR T-cell infusion, side effect management and discharge management. Discussion(s): The included publications are largely based on experiences of CAR T-cell centers and consensus opinions. In the absence of randomized data, no strengths of evidence were assigned to the recommendations. The importance of assessments was elaborated by linking them to the nursing process. Little evidence was found on counseling, illness experience and coping. Conclusion(s): There is a high degree of consensus in the selected literature on the recommendations derived. Their application contributes to safe patient care. There is a need for research on nursing problems and their treatment in the daily care of pediatric patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy.

T1  - 2Acute kidney injury in patients with cancer: the role of palliative care
T3  - 1st Scientific and Training Conference Nephrooncology. Gdansk Poland.
A1  - Lichodziejewska-Niemierko M. 
Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common form of kidney disease that occurs in patients with cancer.1 The causes of AKI in the setting of malignancy are similar to those in other clinical settings and include prerenal, renal, and postrenal entities. Prerenal AKI can be due to fluid depletion (poor intake, vomiting, diarrhea), hypercalcemia, and medications, for example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticancer drugs. Renal causes comprise glomerular nephropathies, tubulointerstitial pathology (acute tubular necrosis, contrast nephropathy, cast and uric acid nephropathy [eg, tumor lysis syndrome]), and thrombotic microangiopathy. Extrarenal obstruction causing postrenal AKI may be due to primary disease, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, or fibrosis.The incidence and severity of AKI depends on the type and stage of cancer, functional status, and comorbidities. Morbidity and mortality rates increase in the presence of critical illness and the need for renal replacement therapy. While dialysis may be perceived as a life-saving therapy, in many cancer patients, especially with end-stage disease, it may present as a futile, life-sustaining treatment associated with functional and psychological burdens.Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on improving the quality of life of both the patient and the family. It should be provided in the early stages of chronic disease with the goal of relieving physical, psychological, social, and spiritual symptoms. It may help patients cope with emotional distress, as well as increase their understanding of the prognosis. In addition, it may facilitate choosing appropriate therapeutic pathways in accordance with the patient's priorities and goals of care. Instead of providing treatments that answer the question of What interventions are available-, the patient-centered vision of care should address the issue of treatment goals that are attainable and desired for that particular patient, and how they can be translated into medical care.Unfortunately, palliative care consultation is underused and rarely offered to patients and families with AKI, especially those hospitalized in the intensive care unit. A patient-physician relationship that promotes shared decision making is recommended for all patients with AKI. This is one of the recommendations that has been introduced in the form of clinical guidelines in the United States and in many other countries afterwards.3 When the outcome is uncertain, patients may be offered time-limited trials of dialysis, with the goal to withdraw dialysis if it does not provide benefit in the specified time.4Advance care planning has been defined as a process of formal decision making that aims to help patients make decisions about future care that may take effect when patients lose capacity. Advance care planning facilitates the delivery of care that is more in keeping with patient wishes, takes patient's preferences and values into account, and increases patient and family satisfaction with care.Symptom management is crucial for cancer patients experiencing AKI.5 Pain and nonpain symptoms are frequent and affect the quality of life. For mild pain, acetaminophen can be used safely without any dose adjustment, whereas nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should generally be avoided. Gabapentin or pregabalin at reduced doses with or without antidepressants may be added as an adjuvant therapy. For moderate to severe pain, tramadol can be used cautiously (-200 mg/d). Fentanyl and methadone are the preferred opioids for use in patients with end-stage renal disease, while morphine, because of the accumulation of active metabolites, should be given when death is imminent. The dose of opioids should be adjusted: in the case of stage 5 of kidney failure, the dose of fentanyl should be reduced to 50%; methadone, to 50% to 75%; and morphine, to 25% of the usual dose. For agitation, a short-acting benzodiazepine like midazolam is safe to use, but the risk of exacerbating delirium should be considered. Haloperidol is recommended for hallucinations, delirium, and nausea with the dose reduced by 50%. Pruritus can be managed with phosphate binders, emollients, antihistamines, gabapentin, pregabalin, antidepressants, or naltrexone. For dyspnea, ensure optimal fluid balance, and for refractory shortness of breath, fentanyl (12.5 g) every 2 hours subcutaneously or intravenously is recommended, with morphine being left for the end-of-life care. Fatigue should be screened for reversible causes and can be relieved by individualized physiotherapy. Psychological symptoms like depression and anxiety should be diagnosed appropriately and treated with cognitive behavioral therapy or integrative psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram have been proved to be useful and are recommended in chronic kidney disease. Restless leg syndrome and sleep disturbances may be successfully controlled with gabapentin (100-300 mg/d) or pregabalin (25- 75 mg/d) at reduced doses and benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists such as lorazepam, temazepam, zolpidem, zoleplon, and zopiclone. Social and spiritual symptoms should be addressed by strengthening personal relations and bonds, open communication on existential domains (eg, purpose, meaning in life, and capacity for personal growth and self- transcendence), as well as social and financial support. Good collaboration and open and honest communication among oncologists, nephrologists, palliative care teams, and often intensivists, is necessary to guarantee that in the case of sophisticated modes of treatment for AKI, the degree of advanced life support therapy remains proportional to the expected long- term prognosis and quality of life. In addition, provision of palliative care for patients with end- stage cancer is of utmost importance in relieving burdensome symptoms in patients and families.

N2  - With growing public concern about water quality particular focus should be placed on organic micropollutants, which are harmful to the environment and people. Hence, the objective of this research is to enhance the security and resilience of water resources by developing an efficient system for reclaiming industrial/military wastewater and protecting recipients from the toxic and cancerogenic explosive compound-2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), which has been widely distributed in the environment. This research used an anodic oxidation (AO) process on a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode for the TNT removal from artificial and real-life matrices: marine water and treated wastewater. During experiments, TNT concentrations were significantly decreased, reaching the anodic degradation efficiency of above 92% within two hours and>99.9% after six hours of environmental sample treatment. The presented results show the great potential of AO performed on BDD anodes for full-scale application in the industry and military sectors for TNT removal.Copyright Â© 2024. The Author(s).

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of relaxation techniques in altering the coping strategies that were employed by the parents of children with malignancy on active treatment. METHOD(S): It was a randomized non-blinded controlled trial, including pre - and post assessments, comparing a 3-week relaxation intervention with the standard psychological care. Participants were recruited consecutively from two Public Pediatric Oncology - Hematology Departments in Cyprus and Greece. Fifty four parents of children hospitalized with a malignancy, were randomly assigned either to the intervention group (n = 29), receiving the Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) and Guided Imagery (GI) Relaxation Techniques or to the control group (n = 25) receiving only the Standard Psychological Care by nurses and psychologists. Data were collected with the Questionnaire of 'Ways of Coping Checklist' (WofCC). RESULT(S): The results showed that the intervention did not have an impact on the coping strategies that parents employed as these are reflected on the WofCC' factors. The results showed that parents in both intervention and control group prefer using positive ways of coping in stressful situations: positive approach, positive re-evaluation and prayer/daydreaming. CONCLUSION(S): The findings did not support the utilization of PMR and GI as coping strategies altering interventions in this clinical context. However, these findings should be interpreted in light of the short duration of the intervention that under these specific circumstances might have required a more lengthy approach for coping strategies to be altered. Furthermore, the stress relieving properties of these interventions could fortify (although not altering) existing coping strategies.Copyright Â© 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: Self-efficacy, perceived social support, and resilience in caregivers of first-stroke patients are closely related, while the interaction mechanism remains unclear. This research explores the mediation effect of self-efficacy in the relationship between perceived social support and resilience in caregivers of first-stroke patients in China. Method(s): Convenience sampling was designed and used to recruit participants from the General Hospital of Northern Theater in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China, from February to October 2022, in which 207 self-reported participants completed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and General Self Efficacy Scale (GSES). In addition, the mediation effect of self-efficacy between perceived social support and resilience was determined by the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Result(s): Among the 207 caregivers of patients with first-stroke, the mean CD-RISC, MSPPS and GSES scores were (72.17 +/- 11.28), (71.17 +/- 8.99), and (29.64 +/- 5.03) respectively. Caregivers' self-efficacy was positively correlated with perceived social support (r = 0.439, p < 0.01) and resilience (r = 0.730, p < 0.01). Self-efficacy served a mediation function partially between perceived social support and resilience, whose effect accounted for 52.90% of the total. Conclusion(s): Both simple and mediation roles of perceived social support and self-efficacy are established in the relationship of resilience among caregivers of first-stroke patients. Positive social support and self-efficacy are two important targets for future interventional studies, and interventions on them may synergistically improve resilience. Hence, the nurses and community workers should correctly evaluate social support and self-efficacy, confirm the health education requirements, and implement counseling intervention to protect and improve the health of first-stroke patients and their families.Copyright Â© 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - AIM: To gain insight into the post-discharge experiences of parents in relation to the adequacy of preparation for caring for extremely premature infants at home. METHOD(S): A narrative approach was drawn on to facilitate data collection, through face-to-face semi-structured interviews with 14 parents of extremely premature infants. FINDINGS: Constant comparative analysis was used to allow the emergence of five key research themes - emotional and mental health of parents, uncertain outcomes, ongoing health needs of the baby, educational needs of health professionals, and parental support and preparation for transition home. CONCLUSION(S): Parental experience of being discharged home with a premature baby can be emotionally challenging and necessitates a range of support mechanisms to help them to cope with this period of transition. Health professionals can direct parents to appropriate counselling services, resources and peer support groups. Tailored education is needed for community-based health professionals, such as health visitors, to equip them to support parents practically and emotionally during the transition home and beyond. In addition, health professionals can learn much from parents about what is needed to support them.Copyright Â© 2018 RCN Publishing Company Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - School-based immunizations are fear-inducing events for many students and contribute to vaccine hesitancy. We developed an immunization delivery framework called the CARD (Comfort Ask Relax Distract) system that incorporates evidence-based interventions to improve the experience (eg, reduce fear, pain, dizziness). We evaluated CARD in grades 6 and 9 students in Calgary, Canada. In this pragmatic, hybrid, effectiveness-implementation, cluster trial, we randomized 8 Community Health Centres providing regional immunization services to CARD or control (usual care). In the CARD group, public health staff educated students about CARD and planned processes to reduce fear cues and support student coping choices during immunization. Students self-reported fear, pain, and dizziness during immunization using a 0-10 numerical rating scale; staff recorded procedure details, including vaccines administered, fainting episodes, and coping strategies used. Staff participated in focus groups afterward. Altogether, 8839 children from 105 schools in the 2019 to 2020 school calendar year were included. Fear was lower for CARD (mean = 3.6 [SD = 3.1] vs control 4.1 [3.2]; mean difference = -0.5; 95% confidence interval = -0.74 to -0.21; P < 0.001). Effectiveness persisted after stratification by student gender (male and female) and grade level (grade 6 and grade 9). Other symptoms did not differ. Compared with control, CARD students used peers, privacy, muscle tension, and topical anesthetics more; verbal distraction, deep breathing, and adult support were used less frequently (P < 0.05, all analyses). Immunization rate did not differ. Staff reported positive to neutral attitudes about CARD. In summary, this pragmatic trial demonstrated that CARD improved the immunization experiences of students at school.Copyright Â© 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: Supported self-management interventions for individuals with systemic sclerosis (SSc) are needed. We examined the effects of a 12-week resilience-building energy management program (called RENEW) for fatigue and other patient-reported outcomes. Method(s): Participants, who had physician-diagnosed SSc, moderate to severe fatigue, and were >=18 years old, were randomly assigned to RENEW or waitlist control in a 2:1 ratio. The RENEW intervention included an educational website/application plus nine virtual peer-led health coaching sessions. The primary outcome was change in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale. Secondary outcomes were change in Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures of pain interference and depressive symptoms and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Multiple imputation was conducted; linear mixed models were used to assess group differences. A three-way interaction with group, time, and SSc duration was examined in each model. Result(s): Among 173 participants (mean +/- SD age 54.5 +/- 11.7 years; 93% female, 85% White), 47% had diffuse cutaneous SSc; 57% were <=5 years from diagnosis. At 12 weeks, compared to controls, RENEW participants had a clinically meaningful fatigue improvement (beta = -4.7; 95% confidence interval -6.7 to -2.7; P < 0.001) and improvement in all secondary outcomes. Among RENEW participants, individuals with shorter disease duration had greater improvements in fatigue at 12 weeks. Conclusion(s): An mHealth supported self-management intervention improved fatigue and other outcomes, particularly in newly diagnosed patients. This program may be broadly scalable for SSc symptom management. (Figure presented.).Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors.

N2  - PROBLEM: The adolescent years are a formative time when rapid hormonal and physical changes stimulate the developing mind. Exposure to poverty, abuse, violence, and lack of peer and social support causes an increase in vulnerability to the development of mental health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated symptoms of depression and anxiety. Regardless of the risk factors, anxiety and depression continue to be significant health problems, affecting thousands of adolescents yearly in the United States. The first-line treatment recommendation for managing anxiety and depression symptoms is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, access to a provider for CBT treatment is not always an option for many reasons. METHOD(S): This pilot evidenced-based practice project aims to increase access to skills acquired through CBT and improve adolescents' mental health by implementing a brief and evidenced-based CBT program in a school setting. The CBT program for this project is the Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment (COPE) for Teens program consisting of seven 50-55-min sessions. The COPE program was delivered to 22 students in a 7th-grade health class. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Modified for Adolescents measured anxiety and depression scores at baseline, post-intervention, and 2-month follow-up. FINDINGS: Results indicate clinically significant improvements in anxiety and depression scores and showed participant satisfaction. CONCLUSION(S): COPE in the school setting offers a low-risk solution to improving behaviors and emotional intelligence. COPE is a cost-effective solution to the mental health provider shortage.Copyright Â© 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - Background and Objectives: Evidence shows that throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses suffered from emotional symptoms, yet in spite of this, few studies within "positive psychology" have analyzed the emergence/promotion of positive traits, such as hardiness. In this context, the present study aimed to test a model regarding the mediating role of self-efficacy between anxiety experienced at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and hardiness assessed six months later among nurses in critical care units (CCU) in Spain. Material(s) and Method(s): An observational, descriptive, prospective longitudinal study with two data collection periods: (1) from the 1 to the 21 June 2020 (final phase of the state of alarm declared in Spain on 14 March) in which socio-demographic and occupational variables, anxiety (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, DASS-21), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale, GSES) and basal resilience (Resilience Scale-14, RS-14) were assessed, and (2) a follow-up 6 months later (January-March 2021) in which hardiness (Occupational Hardiness Questionnaire, OHQ) was evaluated. To analyze the data, multivariate regressions were performed using the PROCESS macro (simple mediation, model 4). Result(s): A total of 131 Spanish nurses from CCUs, with a mean age of 40.54 years (88.5% women) participated in the study. Moderate and severe levels of anxiety were observed in 19.1% of the sample. Significant and positive correlations were observed between self-efficacy, hardiness and resilience (all p < 0.001). Significant negative correlations were observed between anxiety and self-efficacy (p < 0.001), hardiness (p = 0.027) and resilience (p = 0.005). The indirect effect of anxiety on hardiness through self-efficacy was significant (Effect (SE) = -0.275 (0.100); LLCI = -0.487, ULCI = -0.097), contributing to 28% of the variance, including resilience (p = 0.015), age (p = 0.784), gender (p = 0.294) and years of experience (p = 0.652) as covariates. A total mediation was observed (non-significant anxiety-hardiness direct effect; Effect (SE) = -0.053 (0.215), t = 0.248, p = 0.804, LLCI = -0.372, ULCI = 0.479). Conclusion(s): The results suggest that in Spanish CCU nurses, anxiety experienced at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to the development of hardiness through positive resources such as self-efficacy.

N2  - Chronic stress and chronic pain share neuro-anatomical, endocrinological, and biological features. However, stress prepares the body for challenging situations or mitigates tissue damage, while pain is an unpleasant sensation due to nociceptive receptor stimulation. When pain is chronic, it might lead to an allostatic overload in the body and brain due to the chronic dysregulation of the physiological systems that are normally involved in adapting to environmental challenges. Managing stress and chronic pain (CP) in neurorehabilitation presents a significant challenge for healthcare professionals and researchers, as there is no definitive and effective solution for these issues. Patients suffering from neurological disorders often complain of CP, which significantly reduces their quality of life. The aim of this narrative review is to examine the correlation between stress and pain and their potential negative impact on the rehabilitation process. Moreover, we described the most relevant interventions used to manage stress and pain in the neurological population. In conclusion, this review sheds light on the connection between chronic stress and chronic pain and their impact on the neurorehabilitation pathway. Our results emphasize the need for tailored rehabilitation protocols to effectively manage pain, improve treatment adherence, and ensure comprehensive patient care.

N2  - The COVID-19 outbreak has left families with many adverse effects that can disrupt functioning. The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between family functioning and community resilience during the COVID-19 lockdown. An online survey was conducted with community-dwelling adult people (n= 411) based on quantitative descriptive-correlational research. According to the results, families show dysfunctional trends during the COVID-19 outbreak (%56), especially in affective involvement, problem-solving, and behavior control categories. Community resilience was positively associated with family functioning. Also, income dissatisfaction, use of social services, and social trust were determined as predictors of family functioning in the COVID-19 lockdown. Further research and social work practices in public health to address the family system as a whole should be evaluated and interventions aiming at community resilience should be designed to increase families' functioning during the pandemics.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Recruitment and retention of qualified nurses in critical care is challenging and has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Poor staff wellbeing, including sickness absence and burnout contribute to a high staff turnover and staff shortages. This scoping review charts wellbeing interventions targeting nurses who work in adult critical care. METHOD(S): Following the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology, five databases were searched: Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library alongside a search for grey literature targeting national and international critical care nurse organisations. Primary research studies (qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods), as well as quality improvement studies and policy frameworks published from January 1997 to September 2022 were included. Studies conducted outside an adult critical care setting or not including adult critical nurses were excluded. Extracted data were charted using a series of tables. RESULT(S): 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most of the interventions targeted personal rather than organisational strategies, focusing on resilience training, mindfulness-based interventions, and other psychological approaches. One intervention was not evaluated. Most of the rest of the studies reported their interventions to improve wellbeing. However, only one study evaluated the intervention for longer than six months. CONCLUSION(S): Current evidence identified that critical care nurse wellbeing is an international concern affecting recruitment and retention. Most available wellbeing interventions take a psychological, personal approach. However, these may not address the complex interaction of organisational factors which impact adult critical care nurses. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Further work is needed to identify and evaluate organisational approaches to improving wellbeing and to evaluate wellbeing interventions over a longer period of time. Critical care nurses should be included in the design of future wellbeing interventions.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: Runaway, sexually victimized adolescents require evidence-based interventions focused on reducing trauma symptoms, fostering healing, and promoting healthy development. The Minnesota Runaway Intervention Program (RIP), a nurse designed and health care focused intervention, aims to support sexually abused and exploited adolescents who have run away by reconnecting them to supportive relationships, resources, and environments. Theoretically informed by developmental traumatology, resilience theory, and positive youth development, this complex and individualized intervention proposes that enhancing participants' protective factors will to contribute to improvements in participants' health and well-being. The present study tested the underlying theoretical framework of the RIP. Method(s): We conducted parallel process latent growth models with ten years of longitudinal administrative and questionnaire data from RIP participants (N=666). Participants had two to four program assessments that occurred between program entry and Month 24. One of the parallel process models evaluated the relationship between the trajectories of emotional distress (health outcome) and school connectedness (protective factor) with the intervention elements, nurse-participant visits, nurse case management, nurse-parent visits, and therapeutic empowerment group sessions, included as time-varying covariates. The model was specified to determine if: a) increases in the school connectedness rate of change were associated with decreases in the emotional distress rate of change, and b) the intervention elements contributed to increases in school connectedness. Time scores were used in MPlus to accommodate participants' individually-varying follow-up assessments. Missing data was handled using full information maximum likelihood. Result(s): Participants ranged in age from 11 to 17 years (M=14.7, SD=1.4). Most participants identified as girls (92.9%), 5.9% as boys, and 1.2% as transgender. The sample was ethnically diverse: 30.3% of participants identified as African American, 20.9% as multi-ethnic, and 18.0% as Hmong, Asian, or Pacific Islander. Most participants were enrolled in school (97.9%) and 83% received a free or reduced school lunch. The parallel process model demonstrated improvements in school connectedness. A one unit increase in the school connectedness rate of change was associated with a -0.842 (p<.001) unit decrease in the emotional distress rate of change. Three of four intervention elements significantly contributed to increases in school connectedness scores at follow-up: nurse-participant visits at assessments 2 (0.031, p=.001) and 3 (0.021, p<.001), therapeutic empowerment group sessions at assessments 2 (0.025, p<.01) and 3 (0.014, p<.01), and nurse-parent visits at assessment 4 (0.039, p<.05). Conclusion(s): This study provides insight into the RIP's mechanisms of effect. The results are congruent with the RIP's underlying theoretical framework suggesting that the intervention functions as theorized. The findings suggest that fostering and enhancing protective factors, such as school connectedness, can help promote health and well-being among sexually abused and exploited runaway adolescents. This approach may be transferable to other adolescent populations who have experienced trauma. Further, this study demonstrates parallel growth curve modelling is a useful analytical approach to evaluate complex individualized interventions.

N2  - Purpose: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face significant health challenges and have limited access to healthcare. Approximately one-third of YEH are pregnant or parenting, yet few interventions exist to meet the health needs of pregnant and parenting YEH (PPYEH) and their children. In partnership with a local housing program for PPYEH, this mixed-methods community-based participatory research study assessed the effectiveness of a multi-component shelter-based health empowerment program (EMPOWER) that sought to strengthen connections with health services for PPYEH and their children, improve child and adolescent health, and support adolescents' reproductive life goals. Method(s): We conducted intake, exit, and one-month follow up surveys among PPYEH (n=28), semi-structured interviews with PPYEH (n=4), a focus group with PPYEH (n=1), and key informant interviews with shelter staff (n=6). We conducted descriptive analysis of quantitative survey data to assess connections with primary care, mental health, and contraceptive use and access. Additionally, our team of four independent coders conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. Result(s): In both the surveys and interviews, PPYEH and staff reported that EMPOWER helped youth connect with healthcare (eg. primary care, dental, and vision care, sexual healthcare, and mental healthcare). They also stated that EMPOWER promoted youth resilience and agency in navigating the healthcare system. One youth said, "Instead of doing it for us, they show us how to do it so we know in the future when we are alone how to go about doing this." PPYEH reported several ways that EMPOWER improved health among youth and their children, including increased knowledge and skills surrounding several topics (e.g. nutrition, allergies, healthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections). Five youth (n=8) in entry surveys reported having little pleasure or interest in doing things for at least several days. One-month follow up surveys demonstrated that mental health had improved; only one youth (n=7) reported having little pleasure or interest in doing things some of the time. EMPOWER supported youth's reproductive life goals through on-site access to pregnancy tests, condoms, and birth control. Youth also reported increased knowledge of contraceptive options. Several youth reported that they decided to use contraception only after learning about more options; "At first I wasn't going to get [birth control] because I didn't want to get the Depo shot again and I didn't want to get the arm one but knowing that there's ones other than those helped." 100% of interviewed participants enthusiastically recommended expanding EMPOWER to other emergency shelters. Participants also described several opportunities for program improvement, including youth involvement in topic selection for health group and staff training. Conclusion(s): Our qualitative and quantitative data suggest that EMPOWER increased healthcare access, improved child and adolescent health, and supported PPYEH in their reproductive life goals. Additionally, youth and staff were satisfied with the program. Future research will further adapt EMPOWER based on suggestions from this analysis and will scale this intervention to other programs that support PPYEH.

N2  - Objectives Treatment adherence in adolescents with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), ranges from 2%-93%, with the frequency of non-adherence ranging from 3%-57%.1 Nonadherence to a prescribed treatment regimen has significant clinical consequences. This research aimed to develop a novel, user-centred and theory-driven behavioural intervention to support young people (aged 13-18) with IBD adhere to their treatment plan. Methods Findings from a systematic review evaluating treatment adherence interventions for young people with IBD were synthesised with findings from exploratory, qualitative interviews with young people with IBD, parents of young people with IBD and healthcare professionals. Findings were then mapped to psychological constructs from relevant behaviour change theories and behaviour change techniques selected. Following a Behaviour Change Wheel approach,2 a novel intervention was developed, specifically addressing the treatment adherence needs of young people (aged 13-18) with IBD. A series of co-development workshops were conducted with young people (aged 13-18) with IBD. Within these workshops, young people provided feedback on the proposed intervention's components and delivery, using a variety of participatory methods. Young people's ideas were incorporated into a revised version of the intervention, aiming to improve its acceptability and feasibility. Further revisions were made in response to feedback collected from parents of young people with IBD. Results A prototype behavioural adherence intervention was co-developed with young people and parents to support treatment adherence in young people with IBD. Ten interactive online modules aimed to increase young people's confidence to adhere to their treatment plan, support resilience to overcome adherence barriers, assist in the development of health communication skills and generate optimism about the future. Interactive online modules and components within each module can be tailored by the user to suit their own personal adherence challenges. Within each module young people are supported to develop user-centred action plans to improve their treatment adherence behaviours. These plans and corresponding behaviour change strategies are retained within the intervention modules, providing a personalised approach. A parent version of the intervention was also developed to support incremental transfer of responsibility for treatment adherence to young people themselves, as part of their transition to adulthood and adult services. Conclusions The Behaviour Change Wheel approach can be effectively used to co-create a user-centred and theory-driven behavioural intervention with young people. The developed intervention can be tailored to individual needs to support young people's adherence. Further research is needed to establish the intervention's feasibility and preliminary effectiveness.

N2  - Objective: To explore the effect of breathing meditation training on nursing work quality, occurrence risk of adverse events, and attention level of operating room nurses. Method(s): Taking the starting time of breathing meditation training of operating room nurses in our hospital in July 2020 as the dividing line, operating room nurses who implemented routine management from April 2020 to June 2020 were selected as the control group (n=30), and operating room nurses who carried out breathing meditation training from July 2020 to September 2020 were included in the intervention group (n=30). The emotional state [Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score], Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) score, electrocardiogram indicators (blood pressure, pulse, and respiration), electroencephalogram indicators (SMR wave, beta wave, and theta wave EEG frequency), attention level (attention quotient, visual attention, and auditory attention), nursing work quality (health education, theoretical knowledge, nursing operation, and operating room management) and the number of reported adverse events were compared between the two groups before and after training. Result(s): After breathing meditation training, the intervention group's Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores were significantly reduced (P < .05), while the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) score was significantly increased (P < .05). ). In addition, blood pressure and respiratory rate were reduced in the intervention group (P < .05), with significant differences compared with the control group (P < .05). The SMR waves and beta waves in the intervention group increased (P < .05), while theta waves decreased (P < .05). Attention quotient, visual attention and auditory attention scores were improved in the intervention group compared with the control group (P < .05). The scores of health education, theoretical knowledge, nursing operations and operating room management of the intervention group after training were higher than those of the control group (P < .05). The intervention group reported a lower number of adverse events than the control group (74.42% vs. 25.58%). The application of breathing meditation training in special training for operating room nurses can effectively relieve negative emotions, enhance mindfulness scores, reduce blood pressure and respiratory rate, regulate brain wave frequency, improve attention status and quality of nursing work, and reduce the risk of adverse events. These outcomes may have a positive impact on improving the quality of nursing practice and patient care in the operating room. For operating room nurses, the negative emotional stress caused by sustained high levels of mental concentration may affect work efficiency and the entire surgical process. Breathing meditation training can enhance nurses' emotional resilience, thereby improving the efficiency and safety of operating room care. Conclusion(s): The application of breathing meditation training in the special training of operating room nurses can effectively alleviate negative emotions, enhance the mindfulness score, reduce blood pressure and respiratory rate, regulate brain wave frequency, improve the attention state and nursing work quality, and reduce the occurrence risk of adverse events. Future research should conduct longitudinal studies to evaluate the long-term effects of breathing meditation training on the quality of nursing work and the prevention of adverse events. Additionally, research could explore advanced neuroimaging techniques to gain structural insights, integrate meditation into existing training programs, tailor interventions for different healthcare settings, assess patient outcomes, explore technology-assisted meditation, and investigate interprofessional collaboration. Through these pathways, a more complete understanding of the impact and best integration of breath meditation in healthcare settings can be achieved, providing valuable insights into improving the well-being of healthcare professionals and potentially overall patient care and satisfaction.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Objective: We synthesized the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on depression in pregnant women. Method(s): Ten electronic databases were searched from inception to September 2022. We reviewed studies on outcomes for pregnant women with depression receiving mindfulness-based interventions. We only reviewed studies written in English. A random-effects model was used to compute the effect size. Funnel plot, Q statistics, and I2 were used to test the heterogeneity across studies. We examined moderators to explore sources of heterogeneity. Result(s): Across 19 included studies (N = 1480), 717 pregnant women participated in mindfulness interventions; 763 served as controls. Mean age ranged from 25.3 to 33.6 years. Overall, mindfulness-based interventions showed reduced depression compared to control groups (g = 0.457, 95%CI 0.254, 0.659, I2 = 68 %). With subgroup analysis, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy had a greater effect on reducing depressive symptoms (g = 1.13) than mindfulness-based stress reduction (g = 0.64) and adapted mindfulness-based interventions (g = 0.31). No quality indicators moderated the ES of mindfulness-based interventions on depression. Conclusion(s): Mindfulness-based interventions significantly improved depression among pregnant women, especially mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Clinicians and health providers should consider using MBIs as alternative complementary treatment for improving and preventing depression in pregnant women.Copyright Â© 2024

N2  - Rationale and Objectives: To investigate the effect of resident-run wellness retreats on measures of stress, resilience, and cohesion amongst radiology residents. Material(s) and Method(s): All diagnostic and interventional radiology residents in a single academic medical center were invited to participate in a wellness-focused off-campus retreat. Three retreats were held on an annual basis from 2018 to 2022 and included physical exercises, nutritional wellness, and team-building activities. Participants were surveyed pre- and post- retreat attendance focusing on the following domains: Perceived Stress Scale, higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived stress; Brief Resilience Scale, higher scores indicating greater resilience; Cohesion Scale, higher scores indicating greater cohesion. Paired t-tests and linear regression models were used to compare mean Perceived Stress, Brief Resilience, and Cohesion Scales pre- and post-retreat across covariates. Result(s): Of 78 total retreat attendances, 75 residents (96%) completed pre- and/or post-surveys. Study population was 51% female and 49% male, with mean age 29 +/- 2.8 years. Comparing post- with pre-surveys, retreat attendance was associated with a significant reduction in mean Perceived Stress (12.7 vs 16.3; 95% CI 2.1-5.3) and significant increase in Brief Resilience (3.9 vs 3.7; 95% CI 0.05-0.34) and Cohesion (33 vs 27; 95% CI 4.3-6.7). First year residents experienced the greatest increase in Cohesion compared to fourth year residents (p < 0.001). Pre-retreat cohesion was significantly lower in 2022 than in 2018-2019 (26.6 vs 28.7 vs 28.6; p = 0.04), with stress and resilience not significantly different by year. Conclusion(s): An annual resident retreat decreased stress, while increasing resilience and cohesion within a radiology residency, supporting retreats as a potentially viable intervention to promote physician well-being.Copyright Â© 2024 The Association of University Radiologists

T1  - Rehabilitating the mind: Avatar (2009), Inception (2010) and the science fiction imagining of lucid dreaming in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in the U.S. military
A1  - Smith S. 
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Transcultural psychiatry has increased awareness of alternative approaches to mental health and wellbeing, influencing developments in Western psychotherapeutic treatments. In this article, I look at the recent interest in alternative therapies by the U.S. military, which has explored the possibilities of lucid dreaming in order to help soldiers cope with the adverse mental and emotional effects of combat-commonly referred to as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this context of concerns about effective rehabilitation and the cost of veteran care, I examine the popular science fiction films Avatar and Inception, which have been discussed in the media as illustrations of the potential use of lucid dreaming and digitally created virtual worlds to "heal" the minds of soldiers affected by modern warfare. In these media portrayals, psychology and science fiction come together to envision and promote human-machine fantasies of the endlessly salvageable and, therefore ultimately, invincible American soldier.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - The coronavirus pandemic has generated and continues to create unprecedented demands on our healthcare systems. Healthcare workers (HCWs) face physical and psychological stresses caring for critically ill patients, including experiencing anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Nurses and nursing staff disproportionately experienced COVID-19-related psychological distress due to their vital role in infection mitigation and direct patient care. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the short- and long-term impact of COVID-19 stress exposures on nursing staff wellbeing and to assess the impact of wellbeing programs aimed at supporting HCWs. To that end, the current study aims to evaluate an evidence-informed peer support stress reduction model, Stress First Aid (SFA), implemented across units within a psychiatric hospital in the New York City area during the pandemic. To examine the effectiveness of SFA, we measured stress, burnout, coping self-efficacy, resilience, and workplace support through self-report surveys completed by nurses and nursing staff over twelve months. The implementation of SFA across units has the potential to provide the workplace-level and individual-level skills necessary to reduce stress and promote resilience, which can be utilized and applied during waves of respiratory illness acuity or any other healthcare-related stressors among this population.Copyright Â© 2024 by the authors.

N2  - Background A mindfulness-based stress reduction program combined with music therapy is one of the interventions designed to help patients cope with stress and depression. Objective The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an online mindfulness-based stress reduction program combined with music therapy on stress, depression, and psychological well-being in adult patients with cancer. Methods This study was a single-blinded, prospective, randomized-controlled experimental design. One hundred twenty cancer patients were recruited (60 each in the intervention and control groups). Patients in the intervention group received a 10-day mindfulness-based stress reduction program combined with music therapy. Stress was measured with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-State, psychological well-being was measured with the Psychological Well-being Scale, and depression was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory at baseline and the end of the study. Results The intervention group showed significantly lower stress and depression scores than the control group in the total scores at 10 days (P <.05). The intervention group had significantly higher scores in the psychological well-being (P <.001) than the control group at 10 days. Intragroup comparison of the stress and depression scores showed that posttest score of the intervention group was significantly lower than its pretest score (P <.05). Conclusion Mindfulness-based stress reduction program combined with music therapy reduced the levels of stress and depressive symptoms and improved psychological well-being in cancer patients. Implications for Practice A nurse-led mindfulness-based stress reduction program combined with music therapy is an innovative and effective psychological intervention that may be integrated with regular patient care for adults receiving treatment of cancer.Copyright Â© Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Objectives To evaluate how an approach to antidepressant deprescribing works, for whom, and in what contexts by (1) examining the experiences and perceptions of the approach for antidepressant users, (2) identifying the mechanisms of the approach and (3) describing what contexts are associated with antidepressant tapering. Design This mixed methods study was informed by the principles of realist evaluation and was conducted in the first 3 months of participation in the WiserAD randomised control trial. Setting General practice, Victoria, Australia. Participants 13 antidepressant users from general practice participating in the WiserAD trial for antidepressant deprescribing. Intervention A patient-facing, web-based structured support tool that consists of a personalised tapering schedule, an action plan for managing withdrawal symptoms, a daily mood, sleep and activity tracker and mental health nurse support. Primary/secondary outcome measures The outcomes of the study were revealed on data analysis as per a realist evaluation approach which tests and refines an initial programme theory. Results The contexts of learnt coping skills, knowledge and perceptions of antidepressants and feeling well were evident. Outcomes were intention to commence, initiation of deprescribing and successful completion of deprescribing. Key mechanisms for antidepressant deprescribing were (1) initiation of the deprescribing discussion; (2) patient self-efficacy; (3) provision of structured guidance; (4) coaching; (5) mood, sleep and activity tracking and (6) feelings of safety during the tapering period. Conclusions The WiserAD approach to antidepressant deprescribing supported participants to commence and/or complete tapering. The refined programme theory presents the WiserAD pragmatic framework for the application of antidepressant deprescribing in clinical practice.

N2  - Purpose: A single-arm trial evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes of COPE-D, a collaborative care intervention for underserved cancer patients with depression. Method(s): Bilingual (Spanish and English) care managers provided counseling and/or medication management in consultation with physicians. Outcomes were treatment improvement (>= 5-point reduction in PHQ-9), treatment response (>= 50% reduction in PHQ-9), suicidal ideation resolution, and changes in depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-2), sleep disturbance (PSQI), global mental and physical health (PROMIS), social isolation (PROMIS), and qualitative feedback. Result(s): 193 patients consented to participate. 165 initiated and 141 completed treatment, with 65% and 56% achieving treatment improvement and response, respectively. Outcomes did not differ by ethnicity (31% Hispanic), cancer stage (71% stages III-IV), income, or education. Suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and social isolation also improved. Qualitative feedback was largely positive. Conclusion(s): COPE-D improved depression and quality of life among underserved patients, with acceptable retention rates.Copyright Â© 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Background: The grief that accompanies witnessing the death of a child puts health care professionals at risk of secondary trauma, burnout, and turnover when left unaddressed. Objective(s): Support staff well-being and promote resiliency. Method(s): Descriptive implementation of a structured, peer-to-peer bereavement support program for intensive care unit (ICU) staff at a tertiary children's hospital. Result(s): Thirty-five virtual sessions were held over the period of one year.Through these sessions, participants shared perspectives and normalized reactions, and explored potential coping strategies. Post-session feedback surveys demonstrated the negative impact of a death on the personal or work life of ICU staff. Additionally, nearly all reported some level of burnout. Conclusion(s): The sessions were feasible and positively impacted staff coping and well-being. Barriers and facilitators to session attendance, as well as suggestions for improvement, were also explored. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

N2  - Introduction: Trauma-related nightmares (TRNs) are a core symptom of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), so much so that some authors consider them as a hallmark of PTSD or more, as a central physiological mechanism. The study of TRNs is of particular interest in clinical practice, as they generate fear of sleep, sleep fragmentation and poor sleep habits (i.e. alcohol consumption and screen use). Subjective descriptions from patients highlight a sudden awakening, accelerated heart rate, excessive sweating, and intense anxiety. However, laboratory studies are not always consistent with subjective complaints, probably due to methodological constraints. Indeed, changes in sleeping environment and schedule, as well as the clutter of polysomnography (PSG) recording, can alter the frequency and content of nightmares. Our team has developed an innovative methodological approach to study TRNs under ecological conditions, with the aim of establishing relationship between physiological responses before and after waking with patient complaints. Material(s) and Method(s): We conducted a prospective, multicentric, national, observational study (SOMMEPT) involving the psychiatry departments of 5 French Military Teaching Hospitals. During this study, after two habituation nights, military service members suffering from PTSD had to record 5 nights at home using two ambulatory devices, an EEG headband (DREEM, DH, Rythm Paris) in order to quantify and classify sleep stages, and a multi-sensor wristband (E4, Empatica US) in order to measure electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature, heart rate and movement. E4 wristband is also equipped with a push-button to signal any arousal related to TRNs during the night. Result(s): We recorded 367 awakenings associated with TRNs in 70 patients which were compared to 4,165 awakenings not associated with a nightmare. 31.06% (115) of awakenings associated with TRNs occurred after REM sleep, compared with 68.93% (252) after NREM sleep. Physiological analyses revealed higher EDA during the 10 minutes preceding awakenings when TRNs were associated with NREM sleep than when they occurred during REM sleep (p<0.001). Comparing the 10-min periods preceding awakenings associated with TRNs to those preceding awakenings without reported nightmares, we observed higher levels of movement and a localized increase in heart rate before TRNs (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): The use of wearable devices enabled us to corroborate patients' complaints about TRNs. Our analyses showed physiological activations during TRNs that could be incorporated into a more complex predictive model taking into account the temporality of these activations. A better understanding of sleep disturbances and the physiological responses associated with TRNs would allow the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

N2  - Aims This systematic review aimed to review the literature on interventions for improving self-management and wellbeing in adolescents and young adults (11-25 years) with allergic conditions, including asthma. Methods A search strategy was constructed using Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and Psychinfo. Studies had to be controlled trials or randomised control trials. Databases were searched to February 10, 2019. Quality assessments and data extraction were undertaken independently by two reviewers. Results A total of 30 papers reporting data from 27 studies were included. Studies were conducted in the USA (k=17); Netherlands (k=2); Iran (k=2); Australia (k=2); Jordan (k=1); Canada (k=1); UK (k=1); Germany (k=1). Interventions were of 4 main types: psychological (k=9); E-health (k=8); educational (k=4); peer led (k=5); with 1 intervention focused on breathing re-training. All interventions were for asthma. Psychological interventions used cognitive behavioural or motivational interviewing methods, emotional disclosure, stress management or problem solving to improve health outcomes. Significant improvements in the intervention group compared to the control group were found for self-esteem, quality of life, self-efficacy, coping strategies and mood alongside improvements in asthma symptoms. E-Health interventions included the use of webbased computer tailored information, telecommunication compressed videos or mobile applications. Significant improvements were seen across most studies in inhaler technique, adherence, quality of life and in asking questions about asthma medication, triggers and environmental control. Educational interventions included group sessions focusing on asthma prevention and management, individual coaching sessions and nurse-led asthma clinics. They demonstrated significantly improved management of asthma symptoms, improved controller medication use and increased use of a written management plan, reduction in symptoms and improved quality of life. The peer led interventions included the Triple A (Adolescent Asthma Action) programme and a peer-led camp based on the Power Breathing Programme. Improvements were found for self-efficacy, school absenteeism and quality of life. Conclusion Although significant improvements were seen across all intervention types, many studies were small feasibility or pilot studies and no studies for allergic conditions other than asthma met the inclusion criteria. Large longitudinal interventional studies across the range of allergic conditions are required to strengthen the evidence base.

N2  - Introduction: Military service members, due to their deployments in warzones, are particularly exposed to the risk of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Sleep disturbances, including trauma-related nightmares (TRNs) and insomnia, are the most frequent complaint of patients suffering from PTSD and are often a persistent symptom over the long term because they are resistant to the therapies classically used in this pathology. Different studies have shown that sleep disturbances are a contributing factor to the onset and chronicisation of PTSD. However, the study of these nocturnal manifestations is particularly difficult to carry out in the sleep lab and does not always corroborate the patients' complaints. Our aim is to investigate sleep disturbances using a wearable device at home in PTSD patients, and their relationship to the full spectrum of PTSD symptoms, which would make sleep a promising therapeutic focus in the treatment of PTSD. Material(s) and Method(s): We implemented a large observational study in several Military Teaching Hospitals on a population of military and ex-military patients suffering from PTSD. After two habituation nights, the patients wore for 5 nights an EEG headband (Dreem, DH, Rhythm Paris) to record their sleep. The patients also completed several questionnaires concerning their sleep, the nature of their nightmares (TRNS-FR) and the symptomatic impact of their pathology (among them insomnia, depression, micro-arousals). Result(s): We performed an accurate description of the sleep of 127 patients, showing alterations in sleep efficiency and sleep latency, and a decrease in the proportion of REM and slow wave N2 and N3 sleep in patients compared to a control group of 52 healthy individuals. The clinical relevance of wearable recording devices was demonstrated by the presence of positive correlations between the objective (DH device) and subjective (questionnaires) parameters such as Total Sleep Time (TST) (Spearman's rho=0.4782, p<0.001) and Sleep Onset Latency (SOL) (Spearman's rho=0.4347, p<0.001). The intensity of PTSD symptoms was incorporated into a predictive model taking into account sleep disturbances, insomnia and depression. This model indicates that sleep explains a significant proportion of the variability in PTSD symptoms (R=57.2%, p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Taken together, these results illustrate the importance of considering sleep disturbances in the assessment and care of PTSD patients and pave the way for innovative exploratory and therapeutic approaches focused on sleep.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Identification of patients with high risk of experiencing inability to walk after surgery is important for surgeons to make therapeutic strategies for patients with metastatic spinal disease. However, there is a lack of clinical tool to assess postoperative ambulatory status for those patients. The emergence of artificial intelligence brings a promising opportunity to develop accurate prediction models. METHOD(S): This study collected 455 patients with metastatic spinal disease who underwent posterior decompressive surgery at three tertiary medical institutions. Of these, 220 patients were collected from one medical institution to form the model derivation cohort, while 89 and 146 patients were collected from two other medical institutions to form the external validation cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Patients in the model derivation cohort were used to develop and internally validate models. To establish the interactive AI platform, machine learning techniques were used to develop prediction models, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting machine (eXGBM), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN). Furthermore, to enhance the resilience of the study's model, an ensemble machine learning approach was employed using a soft-voting method by combining the results of the above six algorithms. A scoring system incorporating 10 evaluation metrics was used to comprehensively assess the prediction performance of the developed models. The scoring system had a total score of 0 to 60, with higher scores denoting better prediction performance. An interactive AI platform was further deployed via Streamlit. The prediction performance was compared between medical experts and the AI platform in assessing the risk of experiencing postoperative inability to walk among patients with metastatic spinal disease. RESULT(S): Among all developed models, the ensemble model outperformed the six other models with the highest score of 57, followed by the eXGBM model (54), SVM model (50), and NN model (50). The ensemble model had the best performance in accuracy and calibration slope, and the second-best performance in precise, recall, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), Brier score, and log loss. The scores of the LR model, RF model, and DT model were 39, 46, and 26, respectively. External validation demonstrated that the ensemble model had an AUC value of 0.873 (95%CI: 0.809-0.936) in the external validation cohort 1 and 0.924 (95%CI: 0.890-0.959) in the external validation cohort 2. In the new ensemble machine learning model excluding the feature of the number of comorbidities, the AUC value was still as high as 0.916 (95% CI: 0.863-0.969). In addition, the AUC values of the new model were 0.880 (95% CI: 0.819-0.940) in the external validation cohort 1 and 0.922 (95% CI: 0.887-0.958) in the external validation cohort 2, indicating favorable generalization of the model. The interactive AI platform was further deployed online based on the final machine learning model, and it was available at https://postoperativeambulatory-izpdr6gsxxwhitr8fubutd.streamlit.app/. By using the AI platform, researchers were able to obtain the individual predicted risk of postoperative inability to walk, gain insights into the key factors influencing the outcome, and find the stratified therapeutic recommendations. The AUC value obtained from the AI platform was significantly higher than the average AUC value achieved by the medical experts (P<0.001), denoting that the AI platform obviously outperformed the individual medical experts. CONCLUSION(S): The study successfully develops and validates an interactive AI platform for evaluating the risk of postoperative loss of ambulatory ability in patients with metastatic spinal disease. This AI platform has the potential to serve as a valuable model for guiding healthcare professionals in implementing surgical plans and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.Copyright Â© 2024 The Author(s).

T1  - Secondary traumatic stress in partners of paramedics: A scoping review
A1  - Hill M.A.
A1  - Paterson J.L.
A1  - Rebar A.L. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Paramedics experience post-traumatic stress in their work, and many paramedics turn to their intimate partner for support. However, exposure to traumatic event details can leave partners vulnerable to secondary traumatic stress. Despite substantial research into reducing stress and improving support for paramedics, few studies have investigated their partners' trauma experiences and support needs. This scoping review aimed to examine evidence regarding secondary traumatic stress in paramedic partners. METHOD(S): The MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, EMCare, and Sociology Source Ultimate databases were searched up to November 9, 2022. The results sections of studies published in English involving a sample of paramedic partners that examined the impact of paramedics' work-related exposure to trauma on their intimate partner were extracted for analysis. This scoping review was guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Key themes were generated using a framework synthesis approach. RESULT(S): Five qualitative studies and one quantitative study were included, indicating a paucity of literature regarding secondary traumatic stress in paramedic partners. Post-traumatic stress experienced by paramedics can crossover to paramedic partners in the form of secondary traumatic stress; furthermore, it can have widespread effects on couple functioning. While paramedic partners appear to recognise the need for effective coping strategies, they perceive that little support is available to them. Notably, effective strategies aimed at reducing secondary traumatic stress in paramedic partners are limited. CONCLUSION(S): Further research is required to quantify secondary traumatic stress severity in paramedic partners and explore relationships between post-traumatic stress, secondary traumatic stress, and couple functioning. Further, evaluation of partner support needs and barriers to accessing support is warranted.Copyright Â© 2023 College of Emergency Nursing Australasia. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - PLACEBO AND NOCEBO PHENOMENA: A BIG CHALANGE TO MODERN CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
T3  - 28th Danube Symposium. Graz Austria.
A1  - Jakovljevic M. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Placebo and nocebo are fascinating and universal psyche-body or psychobiological as well as spiritual, social, and cultural phenomena, very important for treatment outcome in medicine in general, not only in psychiatry. As these very important and complex phenomena have been commonly viewed through reductionist lenses in hot debates and discusses, rather than in scientific dialogue, in the literature one can find many controversial definitions, misconceptions and myths about placebo and nocebo effects and responses. For example, many physicians still believe that placebo is just an unethical fraud, has no effect on physiological functions and only affects subjective aspects of illness and not objective measures of disease, helps only in imaginary, psychogenic or neurotic, but not in real, organic disorders. Claiming that is based on deceitful practice, the use of placebo should be minimized and avoided in scientific medicine and clinical psychiatry. Until recently nocebo was less known to majority of health care professionals and the data on it are still scarce. Serious analysis of placebo and nocebo responses may put into question the results of many commercially funded, randomized clinical drug trials which are the cornerstone of evidence based medicine in psychiatry. In medicine, placebo and nocebo phenomena are usually defined as positive or negative nonspecific psychological and physiological responses to inert substance or irrelevant procedure. In addition, a placebo procedure or substance represent an inert or officially nontherapeutic substance or irrelevant procedure, while placebo or nocebo response/effect is positive or negative reaction that follows administration of an inert substance or irrelevant treatment. However, placebo and nocebo phenomena are much more, they are genuine effects and responses that can more or less affect everyone and every kind of treatment. These phenomena have potential to powerfully improve or worsen mental or somatic symptoms without official or proven medical or psychotherapeutic intervention as well as during the standardized treatment. Placebo effects may be defined as positive psychophysiological or salutogenic responses that follow the administration of active and non-active substances/pills or procedures when coupled with affirmative narratives, faith and expectations about the treatment. In opposite way, nocebo effects may be viewed as pathogenic or pathopsychophysiological responses that follow the administration of active and non-active substances/pills or procedures when associated with negative, pessimistic or frightening narratives about the treatment. Placebo response seems to be associated with resiience and salutogenesis-related mechanisms that operate in the service of wellness and health. On the other side, nocebo response may be associated with pathogenesis-related mind body processes which operate in the service of disease, illness and sickness. At the end of the day, placebo and nocebo may represent the personal responses to any kind of treatment, so they are very important phenomena from the perspective of the person-centered medicine. Patients are always subjects who give sense and respond more or less actively to meanings that disease, illness and treatment have for them and their physicians. Inducing/eliciting placebo effects can be understood as a form of supplemental or complementary narrative therapy. Concept of narrative personcentered pharmacotherapy supports a shift from impersonal disease model and demoralizing prognostic skepticism towards optimism and personal recovery broadening treatment goals beyond symptom reduction and elimination to personal recovery. Patients always bring into treatment unique characteristics related to their personal life story, vulnerability, resilience and potential for personal growth as well as proneness to placebo or nocebo responsiveness. Disease has to be treated, but the needs of the suffering person have also to be met, helped with and healed. The close interconnectedness of the spirit, mind, brain, endocrine and immune systems suggests existence of an operating self-aware healing system of human beings which works silently in the background regulating and coordinating all living processes. Activation of this healing and resilience system is followed by the placebo response. Resilience is a protective collection of thoughts, actions and behavior which involves the one's positive attitude toward restoration (optimistic thinking, having faith in getting better), the power to reconstruct (ability to re-integrate overcoming difficulty, confidence to overcome difficulties) and control one's disease (coping skills, ability to control relapse prevention and illness, practicing health plan well), and positive mutual interaction with supportive resource (support from medical experts, from family members, friends and other people). Placebo & nocebo response may be related to one or more optimism-pessimism expectation-activated neuropsychophysiological systems or neuronal circuits, like reward-punishment system, novelty-seeking system, harm-avoidance system. Placebo reactions are positively, and nocebo reactions are inversely related to the reward system activity, as evidenced by measuring dopamine and endogenous release. Nocebo response may be associated with the punishment system activation. According to some opinions, dopamine signaling plays an important role in discrepancy between predicted and actual reward which may be the critical aspect for placebo or nocebo response. The serotonin system through its effects on mood and stress may relate to placebo or nocebo responses so that elevated serotonin activity stimulates the placebo response and counteract the nocebo response in pain syndromes and Parkinson's disease. The endogenous opioid system and cholecystokinin system are also important for placebo and nocebo responses, particularly for analgesia and hyperalgesia. The anterior cingulated cortex, an important anatomical component of the both dopaminergic and opiod systems, is reported to be activated during placebo analgesia, placebo anxiety relief and placebo mood improvement. The prefrontal cortex is related to many functions such as expectation generation, cognitive appraisal, memory retrieval and emotion modulation. A loss of prefrontal control is associated with a loss of placebo response. Mesolimbic and mesocortical modulation of stress and emotions may be also related to placebo or nocebo responses. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity seems to be boosted by pessimistic expectancy, and is supposed to be a direct mediator of the nocebo response. Despite the significant progress that placebo and nocebo research has made over recent decades, particularly in the neurobiology and psychodynamics, many questions and dilemmas still remain open. It seems that our better understanding of placebo and nocebo phenomena demands new models of the psyche-brain networks that simultaneously provide explanations of psychoneurobiological mechanisms and meaning, of symbols and their grounding, of context and its brain-psyche embodiment .The aim and purpose of this presentation is to give a transdisciplinary and integrative overview of the current research and understanding of the placebo and nocebo from the seven perspective (disease perspective, personcentered perspective, cognitive perspective, behavioral perspective, narrative perspective, spiritual perspective and systems perspective) as well as to provide some practical tips on how to manage placebo & nocebo phenomena in clinical practice for the well-being of patients.

N2  - Defining the Problem: A growing body of evidence highlights the need for wellness programs to support health care professionals. Although much of the existing literature centers on practicing physicians and physician trainees, there is growing awareness that these challenges are not unique to physicians and affect all members of the health care team. Traumatic and stressful events will always be a part of health care; how these events are addressed on a personal and team level is essential to the success of a health care system. A Resiliency Center was developed on the basis of the specific concerns and strengths of local stakeholders to support the well-being of employees at University of Utah Health. Initial Approach: The initial approach to evaluating and supporting faculty wellness began concurrent with planning for the Resiliency Center in 2016. Stakeholders were brought together by leaders in Health Sciences to propose a Resiliency Center. Initial data gathering was performed with several survey tools, including the American Medical Association's Mini Z. Planned Initiatives: The Resiliency Center, which is housed in the Office of Wellness and Integrative Health, is intended to serve as an overarching structure to help coordinate the faculty and staff wellness initiatives currently in existence and fill identified gaps. The four pillars of the Center are wellness initiatives, communication skills training, peer support, and an on-site Employee Assistance Program. Next Steps: The current focus is on program development and outreach, with plans to measure the impact of the Center.Copyright Â© 2018

N2  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes can result in distress. Improving Resilience is important in managing these conditions. It is also important to consider the mediating role of diabetes management self-efficacy (DMSE) between diabetes distress (DD) and Resilience. Likewise, understanding how social support (SS) buffers the impact of diabetes distress on Resilience is equally important. METHOD(S): The present study used a cross-sectional design and included 403 participants diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The study was conducted in the south of Iran. The participants were selected through convenience sampling from July 2022 to January 2023. Self-reported questionnaires, namely the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS), Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale (DMSE), Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), and Resilience Scale, were used for data collection in the present study. Structural equation modelling was used for moderated mediation analysis. RESULT(S): The results of the Pearson correlation analysis were indicative of a significant negative correlation (p<0.01) between diabetes distress and diabetes management self-efficacy (r=-0.607), social support (r=-0.417), and Resilience (r=-0.552). The findings further revealed that diabetes management self-efficacy had fully mediated the correlation between diabetes distress and Resilience. Moreover, the results indicated that social support had a moderating role in the DD-resilience link. CONCLUSION(S): The present study's findings offer a new theoretical framework for T2DM that can benefit intervention designers. The results further suggest that promoting diabetes management self-efficacy can be an effective strategy to enhance Resilience and decrease diabetes distress. Also, nurses and other healthcare providers must pay close attention to support resources to improve the patients' Resilience and evaluate the distress associated with diabetes.Copyright Â© 2024.

N2  - Background: A multidisciplinary team of health scientists and educators at an academic medical center came together to consider the various factors that impact well-being among self-identified women working in healthcare and conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify the existing body of knowledge. Objective(s): To examine how well-being is defined, what instruments are used to measure it, and correlation between professional and personal gender-specific factors that impact the well-being of women in healthcare occupations. Method(s): A total of 71 studies published in 26 countries between 1979-2022 were extracted from PubMed. Studies enrolled adult women (18-74 y.o.) healthcare professionals including nurses, physicians, clinical social workers, and mental health providers. Well-being related phenomena such as quality of life (QOL), stress, burnout, resiliency, and wellness were investigated. In this review, women are broadly defined to include any individual who primarily identifies as a woman regardless of their sex assigned at birth. Result(s): The results of our analysis were consistent across the scope of the literature and indicated that women in healthcare occupations endure a significantly higher level of stress and burnout compared to their male counterparts. The following gender-specific factors were identified as having direct correlation to well-being: job satisfaction, psychological health, and work-life integration. Conclusion(s): The findings from this review indicate a need for evidence-based integrative interventions across healthcare enterprises to combat stress and burnout and strengthen the resiliency and well-being of women in healthcare. Using information from this review, our team will launch a comprehensive well-being assessment and a series of interventions to support resiliency and well-being at our academic medical center.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - Deep dyspareunia is one of the main symptoms of endometriosis. It appears to be submerged by a two-way disconnection between patients and their physicians. The aim of our review is to provide clear, ready-to-use advice on how to manage deep dyspareunia overcoming the gap in communication. Sexual history should always be taken as part of routine health care in these regards, using a patient-centered approach. An educational pelvic examination, which actively includes patients in the identification of painful areas, may prove useful to improve patients' understanding of their condition. Correlating painful pelvic areas with sexual positions and inviting patients to adopt alternative positions may represent a simple but extremely effective coping strategy to mitigate pain. Revealing and explaining to partners the nature of the pain is essential to allow them to take part in shared research of coping mechanisms, empowering the couple to make choices and changes. Couples who do not feel comfortable talking about intimacy by themselves may find that including a psychotherapist or a sexual therapist, may be a good way to start communication. Investigating and managing dyspareunia during medical encounters is a medical and ethical duty all healthcare practitioners should pursue.Copyright Â© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.

N2  - Background: Occupational burnout is intricately linked to a spectrum of physical disorders encompassing respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal conditions, as well as manifestations such as headaches, type 2 diabetes, elevated cholesterol levels, chronic fatigue, and muscle pain. Despite this association, there remains a paucity of research on the specific risk factors contributing to burnout among nurses in China. Method(s): This cross-sectional study utilized convenience sampling to recruit participants, with data analyzed from 1,774 nurse staffs. Psychosocial traits were assessed using the Three-Item Loneliness Scale for loneliness, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) for anxiety symptoms, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms, the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale-10 item (CDRISC-10) for resilience, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS) for burn out. Restrictive cubic spline analysis to investigate the dose-response relationship between years of experience and burn out. Multivariate linear regression was employed to investigate the relationship between burnout and various risk factors. Result(s): After controlling for basic demographic variables, good sleep quality was associated with a reduction in emotional exhaustion (beta=-0.307, p<0.001), while loneliness (beta=1.334, p<0.001), depressive symptoms (beta=0.896, p<0.001), and anxiety symptoms (beta=0.504, p<0.001) were significantly associated with increased emotional exhaustion. Moreover, higher levels of resilience were positively associated with personal accomplishment (beta=0.635, p<0.001). Regarding depersonalization, loneliness (beta=0.577, p<0.001), depressive symptoms (beta=0.429, p<0.001), and anxiety symptoms (beta=0.152, p<0.01) were found to increase its level. Conversely, good resilience was associated with a decrease in depersonalization (beta=-0.069, p<0.001). The non-liner association between year of experience and emotional exhaustion was significantly (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Our findings revealed that significant risk factors contributing to burnout among nursing staff including bad sleep quality, loneliness, lower level of resilience, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms. Moreover, a nonlinear correlation between years of experience and the likelihood of experiencing emotional exhaustion was exist.Copyright Â© 2024 Liao, Liu, Luo, Duan, Zhan, Lu and Chen.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The Perinatal Center of the University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden has initiated the telemedical healthcare network "SAFE BIRTH" to coordinate and improve specialized care in non-metropolitan regions for pregnant women and newborns. The network incorporates five intervention bundles (IB): (1) Multi-professional, inter-disciplinary prenatal care plan; (2) Neonatal resuscitation; (3) Neonatal antibiotic stewardship; (4) Inter-facility transfer of premature and sick newborns; (5) Psycho-social support for parents. We evaluate if the network improves care close to home for pregnant women, premature and sick newborns. METHOD(S): To evaluate the complex healthcare intervention "SAFE BIRTH" we will conduct a cluster-randomized controlled stepped-wedge trial in five prenatal medical outpatient offices and eight non-metropolitan hospitals in Saxony, Germany. The offices and hospitals will be randomly allocated to five respectively eight sequential steps over a 30-month period to implement the telemedical IB. We define one specific primary process outcome for each IB (for instance IB#1: "Proportion of patients with inclusion criterion IB#1 who have a prenatal care plan and psychosocial counseling within one week"). We estimated a separate multilevel logistic regression model for each primary process outcome using the intervention status as a regressor (control or intervention group). Across all IB, a total of 1,541 and 1,417 pregnant women or newborns need to be included in the intervention and control group, respectively, for a power above 80% for small to medium intervention effects for all five hypothesis tests. Additionally, we will assess job satisfaction and sense of safety of health professionals caring for newborns (questionnaire survey) and we will assess families' satisfaction, resilience, quality of life and depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms (questionnaire surveys). We will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of "SAFE BIRTH" (statutory health insurance routine data, process data) and barriers to its implementation (semi-structured interviews). We use multilevel regression models adjusting for relevant confounders (e.g. socioeconomic status, age, place of residence), as well as descriptive analyses and qualitative content analyses. DISCUSSION: If the telemedical healthcare network "SAFE BIRTH" proves to be effective and cost-efficient, strategies for its translation into routine care should be developed.

N2  - Introduction Advances in multiple myeloma (MM) treatment improve survival but expose patients (pts) to significant financial toxicity (FT) due to lifelong administration of costly therapies. Financial support services (FSS) like nurse navigators (NN), financial advocates (FA), and social workers (SW) can offset healthcare costs by accessing patient assistance programs. However, these services are underused due to ad hoc referrals and reluctance to discuss financial issues. We developed a financial navigation program (FNP) that proactively identifies pts at risk of FT, comprehensively assesses their needs, systematically connects pts to resources, and follows-up to ensure needs are met. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we assessed whether this FNP reduces FT compared to usual care. Methods We recruited adult pts with MM receiving systemic treatment at the University of Pennsylvania at their follow-up appointments. Consenting pts completed the COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity (COST) questionnaire; those at risk of FT (score<26) were randomized 1:1 to the intervention (FNP) or usual care. We aimed to randomize 82 participants to achieve 80% power based on prior studies (expected improvement in COST by 5 in intervention, 2 in usual care). Pts completed a baseline survey to assess socioeconomic and demographic factors, cost-coping behaviors, quality of life (QoL), and satisfaction. After 4 months, pts completed a similar, final survey. In the FNP, the NN assessed financial and transportation barriers to care by telephone, performed proactive outreach to FA and SW, and coordinated resources, followed by monthly follow-up calls. We measured patient-reported outcomes as change from baseline to study completion; the primary outcome was change in COST score. Secondary outcomes were changes in cost-coping behaviors, QoL, and satisfaction. We performed an intention-to-treat, bivariate analysis (t-test or chi 2 test) of each outcome and conducted rapid thematic analysis of free-text responses. We also observed consenting pts whose baseline COST>=26, and - in post-hoc analysis - assessed for differential change in COST score at follow-up among this cohort vs the randomized/at-risk population. Results We assessed 315 pts from Feb-Dec 2022 ( Figure): 193 consented, 106 randomized, and 83 were included in analysis (41 in intervention, 42 in usual care). Randomized pts were an average of 65 years, 53% female, 39% nonwhite, 78% college-educated, and 51% earned <=$60,000/year. This contrasted with 8% non-white pts among the non-randomized (high baseline COST) group (p<0.001). Despite all randomized pts being insured, 55% reported that MM treatment costs posed a significant financial burden. Many (46%) were on lenalidomide containing regimens. The mean, baseline COST score was 14.4 (SD 7.5) in the intervention versus 16.0 (SD 6.5) in usual care (p=0.3). Most pts had baseline FSS use, with a higher proportion in usual care (76%) than intervention (51%), p=0.03. During a median follow-up of 4.9 months, 17% in usual care received FSS. In the intervention arm, 95% participated in the FNP, with 68% completing >=3 follow-up calls within 4 months. Randomized (at risk) pts showed an average improvement in COST of 4.6 (SD 8.9), significantly different from the non-randomized (low risk) group's mean worsening of -15.8 (SD 7.2) at follow-up; p<0.001. The intervention arm had a greater but non-significant improvement in COST score (mean 5.7 [SD 8.8]) compared to usual care (mean 3.5 [SD 8.9]); p=0.3. There were no significant changes in cost coping behaviors, QoL, or satisfaction between the two randomized arms. There was a significantly higher number of financial assistance applications submitted among pts randomized to the FNP (34%) vs usual care (12%); p=0.02. Patient feedback indicated the FNP improved understanding of FSS and reduced stress. Conclusions In this study, we confirmed that most pts with MM experience financial hardship and are at-risk of FT, despite being insured. We observed significant racial disparities in this risk. Our RCT showed that by screening pts with the COST tool and proactively coordinating FSS for at-risk pts, we can potentially reduce financial hardship. We attribute the non-significant improvement in FT to an under-powered analysis from higher-than-expected improvement in COST among usual care pts. Our program is efficient and scalable and demonstrated high retention.Copyright Â© 2023 The American Society of Hematology

N2  - Background and Aims: To evaluate social robots as a tool to manage anxiety in children coping with health emergencies. The primary endpoint was to evaluate whether the NAO robot could support healthcare providers during their work in EDs by decreasing the anxiety and distress of paediatric patients, which was measured by assessing their heart rates and salivary cortisol production. The secondary endpoint was to explore possible correlations between the demographic and psychological characteristics of the children and their heart rate and salivary cortisol levels. Method(s): This prospective randomised clinical trial was conducted among children attending a paediatric emergency department (ED) from July 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020. A total of 109 children aged 3 to 10 years were enrolled in the study. Result(s): Of the 109 children enrolled, 71 were included in the final analysis (control group, 19; healthcare personnel group, 23; NAO robot group, 29). The significantly positive effect of the NAO robot on the children's anxiety was highlighted by decreased salivary cortisol levels, which were more evident among the girls than the boys. Notably, a more extroverted temperament was related to a lower heart rate in the NAO robot group. Conclusion(s): The NAO robot is an excellent tool for helping children cope with stressful procedures in paediatric EDs.

T1  - Supporting children's nurses to deliver trauma-informed care
A1  - Davies J.A. 
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - World events, such as the conflict in Ukraine, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, have highlighted the effects of trauma and adverse childhood experiences on children and young people. Adverse childhood experiences can lead to suboptimal health and risk-taking behaviours during adolescence and adulthood, while multiple adverse childhood experiences can manifest as complex trauma, toxic stress, anxiety or depression across a person's lifespan. This article discusses adverse childhood experiences and the concept of trauma-informed care, which involves recognising and understanding the negative events that have affected a person and how these relate to suboptimal health. The author suggests that developing resilience and using self-care strategies can support nurses to adopt a trauma-informed approach to care. This can assist them to recognise, understand and reflect on the effects of adverse childhood experiences in themselves as well as in their patients. The author also outlines a hybrid approach to debrief that can support staff to manage stressful situations and challenging workplace experiences.Copyright Â© 2022 RCN Publishing Company Ltd.

N2  - Sleep disorders in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are both diagnostic (nocturnal reliving) and prognostic. Poor sleep worsens the daytime symptomatology of PTSD and makes it resistant to treatment. However, no specific treatment is codified in France to treat these sleep disorders although sleep therapies (cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, psychoeducation and relaxation) have proven for years to be effective in treating insomnia. Therapeutic sessions can be part of a therapeutic patient education program, which is a model for the management of chronic pathologies. It allows for an improvement in a patient's quality of life and enhanced medication compliance. We therefore carried out an inventory of sleep disorders of patients with PTSD. First, we collected data by means of sleep diaries concerning the population's sleep disorders at home. Then we assessed the population's expectations and needs regarding its management of sleep, thanks to a semi-qualitative interview. The data from sleep diaries, which was consistent with the literature, showed that our patients suffered from severe sleep disorders that strongly impact their daily lives, with 87% of patients having an increased sleep onset latency, and 88% having nightmares. We observed a strong demand from patients for specific support for these symptoms, 91% expressing an interest in a TPE program targeting sleep disorders. Thanks to the data collected, the emerging themes for a future therapeutic patient education program targeting sleep disorders of soldiers with PTSD are: sleep hygiene; management of nocturnal awakenings, including nightmares; and psychotropic drugs.Copyright Â© 2023 L'Encephale, Paris

N2  - Background: The unmet need for family planning (FP) is a major impediment to achieving the sustainable development goal The COVID-19 pandemic and other contextual, individual, and hospital-related problems are major barriers that reduce FP service uptake. However, most of the studies are quantitative and give due focus to individual and community-level barriers. Therefore, this study tends to explore barriers to the utilization of FP in Ethiopia including health care and contextual barriers. Method(s): A multiple explorative case study design was employed from October to December 2021 and a total of 41 Key-informant interviews, 32 in-depth interviews, and 13 focus group discussions were performed by using the purposive sampling technique. The data were analyzed with a thematic content analysis approach using NVivo software. Result(s): This study explored barriers to FP in four major teams; individual, community-related, health system, and contextual barriers. It reviled that the community's misconception, fear of side effects, lack of women's decision-making autonomy, existing socio-cultural norms, religious conditions, topography, covid 19 pandemic, and conflict were the major barriers to FP service utilization. Conclusion(s): Using the four teams mentioned above, this study identified different poor health professional skills, misconceptions, pandemics, functional, and structurally related barriers. As a result, it is recommended that health education for the community and training for health professionals are important. Collaboration between government and non-government organizations is also mandatory for strengthening mentorship and supervision systems and establishing resilient health care that can avoid future pandemics.Copyright Â© 2023 Meskerem J, et al.

N2  - Background: Psychological support for chronically ill patients as an integral component of medical care could improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients and contribute to a reduction in treatment costs. A meta-analysis including almost 3,000 patients revealed that persons with hemophilia (PWH) are at increased risk for depression, anxiety, and ADHD compared to the general population (Al-Huniti et al., 2020). Studies have shown that the self-efficacy, coping mechanisms, and HRQoL of parents of hemophilic children were improved by self-help programs, and depression, anxiety, and parenting stress were reduced. Although different psychological interventions have been used to help PWH to cope with their psychological problems, there is a gap between patients' need for psychosocial support from the perspective of health care professionals (HCPs) and their utilization by PWH. The aim of the ILLUSTRATE study was to assess the need for psychosocial support and medical care in patients with inherited bleeding disorders (IBD) and in HCPs and their use in hemophilia centers. Method(s): Patients with IBD (PIBD) were invited by different German patient organizations (Deutsche Bluthilfe, DHG, IGH, Hamophilie 2000) to participate in an on-line surevey (from December 2022-June 2023). In addition, HCPs were asked to complete a similar on-line survey via the mailing list of the German Society for Thrombosis and Hemostaseology. A positive ethical approval for the study was obtained by the Local Psychological Ethics Committee at the University Medical Centre in Hamburg, Germany (LPEK-0578). The questionnaire for patients consisted of the following aspects: socio-demographic data, medical background, care services and psycho-social support, dealing with stress and difficult situations, dealing with special situations that may arise or be exacerbated by the bleeding disorder, offer of psycho-social counseling/support, and need for expansion. The questionnaire for HCPs contained the following themes: personal background, need of patients for psycho-social counseling/support (PSCS), supply of PSCS and need for expansion, utilization, and benefits of PSCS. Result(s): In total, 154 patients and parents of children with an IBD participated (72 PIBD,80 parents, 2 others) with a mean age of 41.06+/-13.3 years, 60.4% were female. In addition, 65 HCPs completed the respective survey (34 physicians, 27 nurses and 4 others) with a mean age of 48.11 +/- 12.7 years, in average they worked since 13.1+/-10.8 years in haemostaseology, 78.5% worked in a hemophilia comprehensive care center (HCCC), 20% in a hemophilia treatment center (HTC) and 1.5% in a homecare service. In the IBD group (patients, parents) most were married (59.1%), lived with a partner (83.8%) and worked full- or part-time (66%). Most PIBD had hemophilia (74%) with a severe form (81.8%). 28.6% of the IBD group felt little to not at all supported to overcome psycho-social challenges. It was demonstrated that they had an intermediate stress resilience (14.76+/-3.1), with 1/3 showing a low resilience. When asking what coping strategies they used in stress situations, 26% mentioned that they ignore difficult situations and 16% compensated their stress with drugs and alcohol. 20% often to always felt helpless and overwhelmed due to their IBD and 31% rarely to never received support in these situations. 71% reported to have a need for PSCS, 57% wished more support services (69% mainly at the HTC), 71% felt not to have enough information about these services and 64% would use them more often if they were more accessible. 52% of HCPs found that the IBD group has a need of PSCS, they assumed that parents and adolescent patients would benefit most of these services and expected the highest advantage from psychological counseling. 60% thought that there is a need for information and education. The IBD group and HCPs preferred PSCS in presence, the IBD group would use services as well via phone or digital. Conclusion(s): Although offered psycho-social support programs are rarely used by patients, a large proportion of the IBD group and HCPs confirmed a need for it. Increased accessibility to PSCS and more information were identified as a factor for increased use of this support programs. Additional digital psycho-social support services were desired and represent a helpful alternative if services are not available on site.Copyright Â© 2023 The American Society of Hematology

N2  - WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: It was previously reported that perceived external locus of control may exacerbate depressive symptoms, is associated with anxiety, boosts stress and general mental distress and weakens resilience against traumatic situations or difficulties. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Those with a higher external locus of control are more prone to develop PTSD symptoms since the perceived external locus of control is among the predictors of PTSD. An internal locus of control is considered important in preventing PTSD, although an external locus of control appears to be a variable that causes/increases the prevalence of PTSD. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: It is known that nurses are deployed in clinical and fieldwork during disaster and assume key roles both interventional practices and psychosocial education. Thus, it is of particular importance for mental health nurses to be aware of the locus of control in themselves, their colleagues, and the community before, during and after disasters to be able to combat the risk/presence of PTSD. ABSTRACT: AIM: The present systematic review explored the impacts of perceived locus of control on PTSD among individuals experiencing disasters. METHOD(S): This is a systematic review study carried out through a search of the relevant research published in English over the period December 2021 to April 2022. Accordingly, we sought the studies to review on the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases using the keywords "Child, Children, Adolescent, Adolescence, Adult, Aged, Elderly, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, Internal-External Control, Locus of Control, Disasters, Natural Disasters." RESULTS: A total of 1.011 studies were found in the five databases using the keywords above. Following the exclusions, the remaining six studies were recruited for this systematic review. The six studies in question addressed earthquakes (2), hurricanes (1), wildfires (1), SARS (1) and fireworks explosions (1). In the study with wildfire survivors, there was a weak significant association between external locus of control and PTSD among those directly exposed to the disaster (r=.15, p<.01). The study with survivors of the SARS epidemic demonstrated that those with a high perceived chance (external) locus of control suffered PTSD (p=.001). An internal locus of control is considered important in preventing PTSD, although an external locus of control appears to be a variable that causes/increases the prevalence of PTSD. CONCLUSION(S): It was concluded that perceived locus of control is related to PTSD in individuals experiencing a disaster. The additional evidence was that post-disaster PTSD among those with a high perceived external locus of control is stronger than those with a high perceived internal locus of control.Copyright Â© 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Background: Military sexual trauma (MST) is reported by up to 74% of women veterans in the United States and is a driver of poor behavioural and physical health. Self-compassion is a transdiagnostic, protective factor linked with improved posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and health behaviours. Thus, Mindful Self-Compassion training (MSC) may help ameliorate MST-related impacts. However, MSC can also temporarily increase distress (i.e. backdraft). Delivering it with elective trauma-informed yoga (TIY), which regulates acute distress, may help address this issue. Objective(s): This VA quality improvement project examined feasibility, acceptability, and reported benefits and challenges of a manualized 8-week MSC including within non-randomized subgroups: MSC (n=4) and MSC+ elective TIY classes (MSC+; n=4). Method(s): Nine women veterans with a history of MST at a Vet Center in the Northeastern U.S.A. enrolled; eight completed, excluding one MSC+ participant. Measures included attrition (n=9), attendance (n=8), weekly (n=8) and posttreatment acceptability (n=6), validated symptom severity assessments (n=7), and an exit interview (n=8). Result(s): Among completers, MSC attendance was excellent (89%) and higher among in MSC+ vs. MSC (94% vs. 84% sessions completed). On average across the two groups, depressive and PTSD symptom severity decreased by 21% and 30%, respectively. In exit interviews, participants across groups described improved coping with distress and psychiatric symptoms, reduced stress, and improved self-care and health behaviours. Although women in both groups reported backdraft during the programme, MSC+ also reported healthier coping and improved emotional processing. Conclusion(s): The results of this programme evaluation infer MSC may be feasible, acceptable, and beneficial for women survivors of MST in one Vet Center in the Northeastern USA. Further, temporary elevations in MSC-related distress may be ameliorated with adjunctive TIY. Given requests of women veterans in the USA. for additional complementary and integrative health treatment options, formal research on these approaches is warranted.

T1  - Hub and Spoke: Next level in regional networks for infection prevention
A1  - Pantano D.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - The threat of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are real and increasing every day. They affect not only healthcare systems but also communities, causing economic and public health concerns. Governments must take action to tackle AMR and prevent the spread of MDROs and regional hubs have a critical role to play in achieving this outcome. Furthermore, bacteria have no borders, consequently, cooperation networks should be extended between countries as a crucial strategy for achieving the success of infection control. Euregions, which are a specific form of cooperation between local authorities of two or more bordering European countries, can help solve common problems and improve the lives of people living on both sides of the border. Regional collaboration strategies can enhance infection control and build resilience against antimicrobial resistance. This review identifies risk factors and the correct approaches to infection prevention and control, including education and awareness programs for healthcare professionals, appropriate prescribing practices, and infection prevention control measures. These measures can help reduce the incidence of antimicrobial resistance in the region and save lives. It is therefore essential to take concrete actions and foster the creation of more effective regional and cross-border centers to ensure the success of infection control policies and the management of healthcare-associated infections. This work sheds light on the issue of MDRO infections within healthcare settings, while also acknowledging the crucial role of the One Health concept in understanding the broader context of these infections. By recognizing the interdependence of human and animal health and the environment, we can take constructive steps toward mitigating the risks of these infections and promoting better health outcomes for all.Copyright Â© 2024 The Authors

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Background: Cultural connection for Aboriginal young people promotes wellbeing, resilience and healing. There is little research on the social and emotional wellbeing (SEWB) impacts of cultural strengthening programs for Aboriginal young people, especially research that includes the perspectives of young people. There is even less research that includes the experiences of Aboriginal young people who have been in out-of-home care. Objective(s): The current study sought to address these research gaps by exploring the SEWB impacts of cultural strengthening programs by amplifying the voice of Aboriginal young people, including those who have been in out-of-home care. Participants and setting: Aboriginal young people involved in an innovative cultural strengthening program, the Narrun Yana art collective, established by the Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency (VACCA). Also participating was VACCA's Team Leader of Children and Youth Programs, thus providing both experiences of participating in and of organising cultural programs. Method(s): A qualitative phenomenological approach was taken. Data consisted of semi-structured interviews with the team leader and two young people and written responses to the interview questions from one young person. Result(s): Lived experience provided evidence that cultural strengthening programs; help strengthen SEWB, including connection to self, relationships, community and culture; contribute to building resilience in the context of intergenerational trauma, cultural loss and racism; and encourage help-seeking, both informal support and accessing mental health services. Young people also viewed participating in the research as worthwhile. Conclusion(s): Findings highlighted the importance of Aboriginal young people having opportunities to; connect to culture through participation in cultural strengthening programs, and engage in the design of these programs.Copyright Â© 2023 The Author(s)

T1  - Compassion Fatigue Resiliency Program Effects on Oncology-Hematology Nurses' Professional Quality of Life, Stress Levels, and Patients' Care Satisfaction: Nurse, Nurse Manager, and Patient Perspectives, a Mixed-Methods Study
A1  - Saribudak T.P.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the Compassion Fatigue Resiliency Program applied to oncology-hematology nurses on the professional quality of life and stress levels of nurses, on the satisfaction of cancer patients, and on the perspectives of nurse managers. DATA SOURCES: An experimental embedded mixed-methods design was conducted between December 20, 2022, and February 20, 2023. The study included 15 oncology-hematology nurses, 19 cancer patients, and 6 nurse managers. Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients and pre-tests were applied to patients and nurses. The Compassion Fatigue Resiliency Program was implemented for the nurses. Then qualitative interviews were repeated with the same patients; focus group interviews were conducted with the nurse managers; post-tests were applied to patients and nurses who participated in the training; and narrative feedback was collected. Quantitative data analysis was carried out using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Qualitative data were processed using an inductive approach to thematic analysis. CONCLUSION(S): Compassion satisfaction decreased after the Compassion Fatigue Resiliency Program. Qualitative results showed that the training program improved nurses' effective communication skills and ability to cope with stress. The program improved nurses' approach to patients and communication, and patients' care satisfaction levels increased. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The Compassion Fatigue Resiliency Program should be included in hospital in-service training programs and implemented and sustained. With this, compassion fatigue of nurses can be reduced or prevented, which will help to avoid the nurse shortages that already existing and increasing.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - There is a wealth of research linking adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) with negative outcomes later in life, but less research has focused on the effects of protective childhood experiences (PCEs). PCEs have been shown broadly to promote resilience, but the precise nature of this association is not clear, particularly in studies of at-risk adults. The current investigation explored the association between recollection of early life experiences and in vivo emotional responses in at-risk adults. In 2018, 56 active-duty firefighters reported childhood experiences via a questionnaire. Using a semistructured interview, firefighters then responded to questions about recent emotionally evocative experiences (positive and negative) as a firefighter. Emotion was measured in vivo via sympathetic arousal and recorded facial expressions of emotion. Individuals who reported more PCEs expressed significantly more facial expressions of positive emotion across contexts, sr2 = .11-.14. Early childhood experiences were not significantly associated with negative facial expressions or changes in sympathetic reactivity, but ACEs were associated with tonic levels of arousal in a negative context, r = -.36. Given the adaptive role of positive emotions in adjustment to adverse events, the current investigation suggests a potential protective association between PCEs and the expression of emotion even within a high-risk context, which could help explain the resilience promoting role of PCEs.Copyright Â© 2023 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.

N2  - Many frontline and essential workers faced increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and even suicide ideation during the pandemic response. These and other factors led to burnout, shifts into non-patient or client-facing roles, or leaving an occupation altogether. Domestic violence advocates experienced increases in many types of stressors as they continued to provide essential services to victims and survivors during the pandemic. However, in most cases they did so without protections offered to essential workers, like priority access to personal protective equipment (PPE) or vaccines. Executive directors of U.S. State and Territorial Domestic Violence Coalitions were identified using the National Network to End Domestic Violence website and contacted via email to schedule key informant interviews. Interviews were conducted, recorded, and transcribed using Zoom. Themes were identified using both inductive and deductive coding. Twenty-five of 56 (45%) coalition executive directors completed an interview. Three main themes related to workforce were identified, including an accelerated rate of job turnover among both leadership and staff; a lack of essential worker status for domestic violence advocates; and unsustainable levels of stress, fear, and exhaustion. While familiar challenges drove these outcomes for this predominantly female, low-wage workforce, such as a lack of access to childcare, other factors, including the lack of access to PPE, training, and hazard pay for those working in person, highlighted inequities facing the domestic violence workforce. The factors identified as impacting the domestic violence workforce-turnover, low status, and high levels of stress, fear, and exhaustion-made the already challenging provision of advocacy and services more difficult. Domestic violence advocates are essential first responders and must be supported in ways that increase the resilience of empowerment-based services for victims and survivors.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As climate change drives more frequent and intense weather events, older adults face disproportionate impacts, including having the highest mortality rates from storms, wildfires, flooding, and heat waves. State governments are critical in deploying local resources to help address climate change impacts. This policy study analyzes states' climate adaptation plans to assess the methods through which they address the impact of climate change on older adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study uses content analysis to analyze available climate change adaptation plans for all U.S. states for strategies designed to increase the resilience of older adults to the impacts of climate change. RESULT(S): A total of 19 states have climate adaptation plans, of which 18 describe older adults as a population group with specific health impacts and risk factors. There are 4 categories of adaptation strategies for older adults that includes communications, transportation, housing, and emergency services. State plans vary in terms of the risk factors and adaptation strategies included. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: To varying degrees, states' climate change adaptation planning addresses health, social, and economic risks specific to older adults, as well as strategies for mitigating those risks. As global warming continues, collaborations between public and private sectors and across regions will be needed to prevent negative outcomes such as forced relocation and other social and economic disruptions as well as disparate morbidity and mortality.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - This research was conducted with the aim of investigating the effect of a spiritual care program (SCP), on the body image and resilience of second-degree burn patients in Iran. In this semi-experimental study, 60 patients with second-degree burns were selected in the Tehran Mottahari Burns Hospital, Iran in 2022. These patients were divided through random allocation into two intervention and control groups. The patients of both groups filled out Beck's self-esteem Test (BSCT) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) before, immediately, and 3 months after the intervention. In the intervention group, SCP was performed for eight sessions over two weeks. Firstly, the 4D Model of Spiritual Health and Well-Being was examined, then two one-hour sessions were held with each patient about each dimension, with a total of four dimensions including eight sessions, in which these dimensions were examined and discussed. There was no difference in the score of body image (P=0.326) and resilience (P=0.597) before intervention in the control and intervention groups. However, the mean of body image score in the intervention group immediately (109.56+/-4.86) and 3 months after (109.16+/-6.06) the intervention was significant, respectively. Also, the mean of resilience score in the intervention group was significant immediately (85.86+/-6.78) and 3 months after the intervention (85.73+/-6.27). It is suggested for healthcare providers to use the SCPs to reduce the recovery time of burned patients and reduce complications and treatment costs.Copyright Â© 2023.

N2  - Background: Reevaluating response plans is essential to ensuring consistent readiness and resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic. The "During Action Review" and Tabletop (DART) methodology provides a retrospective and prospective assessment to inform the adaptive response. Israel introduced COVID-19 vaccinations in December 2020 and was the first country to implement booster vaccination to address waning immunity and surges caused by new variants. We assessed Israel's readiness and resilience related to COVID-19 response while capturing the pre-vaccination and vaccination periods. Method(s): A DART analysis was conducted between December 2020 and August 2021 among experts involved in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. During the retrospective stage, a role-based questionnaire and discussions were undertaken in a participant-led review of the response, focusing on epidemiology and surveillance, risk communication, and vaccines. The prospective stage included tabletop exercises to evaluate short to long-term simulated scenarios. Result(s): Participants emphasized the pivotal role of Israel globally by sharing experiences with the pandemic, and vaccination. Perceived strengths included multi-sectoral collaboration between the Ministry of Health, healthcare providers, academia, military, and others, stretching capacities, expanding laboratory workload, and establishing/maintaining surveillance. The vaccine prioritization plan and strong infrastructure, including computerized databases, enabled real-life assessment of vaccine uptake and impact. Challenges included the need to change case definitions early on and insufficient staffing. Quarantine of patients and contacts was particularly challenging among underprivileged communities. Risk communication approaches need to focus more on creating norms in behavior. Trust issues and limited cooperation were noted, especially among ethnic and religious minorities. To ensure readiness and resiliency, participants recommended establishing a nationally deployed system for bringing in and acting upon feedback from the field, especially concerning risk communication and vaccines. Conclusion(s): Our study appraised strengths and weaknesses of the COVID-19 pandemic response in Israel and led to concrete recommendations for adjusting responses and future similar events. An efficient response comprised multi-sectoral collaboration, policy design, infrastructure, care delivery, and mitigation measures, including vaccines, while risk communication, trust issues, and limited cooperation with minority groups were perceived as areas for action and intervention.Copyright Â© 2024 Muhsen, Cohen, Glatman-Freedman, Husseini, Perlman and McNeil.

T1  - The Relationship of Anti-Transgender Discrimination, Harassment, and Violence to Binge Drinking among Transgender Adults
A1  - Klein H.
A1  - Washington T.A. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Purpose: Using a minority stress paradigm, this paper examines the relationship between anti-transgender discrimination, harassment, and violence among transgender adults. Method(s): Data from the 2015U.S. National Transgender Survey were used to examine twenty types of anti-transgender experiences/problems (e.g., harassment at work, problems with police officials, verbal and physical assaults) in a sample of 27,715 transgender Americans aged 18 or older. Binge drinking during the previous month was the dependent variable, and eight control measures were examined in the multivariate analysis. Result(s): Experiencing any of the twenty types of anti-transgender discrimination, harassment, or violence increased the odds of binge drinking by 48%. Experiencing many such problems increased the odds of binge drinking by 104%. Multivariate analysis showed that anti-transgender discrimination, harassment, and violence remains a predictor of binge drinking even when other key measures are taken into account. Younger people, racial minority group members, and persons who were not married or "involved" were at particularly great risk. Conclusion(s): Consistent with the minority stress paradigm, the more different types of anti-transgender experiences people had, the more likely they were to engage in binge drinking. Targeted intervention needs to help transgender persons to avoid anti-transgender discrimination, harassment, and violence to the greatest extent possible, and to develop resiliency skills whenever they are victimized. This is particularly true for transgender persons who are younger, minority, and not "involved" in a relationship.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which seriously affects the treatment, recovery, and prognosis of patients. OBJECTIVE(S): To observe the effect of empowerment psychological intervention on the status of PTSD in ICU patients. METHOD(S): A total of 86 patients with PTSD who were treated in ICU from July 2019 to December 2021 were divided into two groups according to the intervention method. The control group (n = 43) used routine psychological intervention, while the intervention group (n = 43) used empowerment psychological intervention led by specialist nurses. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess the sleep quality of the patients. The Resilience Questionnaire (CD-RISC) was used to evaluate the resilience of the patients, and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Self-Rating Scale (PTSD-SS) was used to assess the severity of the symptoms. The Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Inventory (HAMA and HAMD) was adapted to assess the degree of anxiety and depression, and the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) was adapted to evaluate the post-traumatic growth of the patients. RESULT(S): After the intervention, the total CD-RISC score and its tenacity, self-improvement, and optimism scores in the two groups were all higher than before, and the total PSQI score and its sleep quality, time, efficiency and impairment, as well as hypnotic drugs, daytime dysfunction and time to sleep were lower than before, and the CD-RISC score in the intervention group was higher than that in the control group, PSQI score was lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). After the intervention, PTSD-SS scores and anxiety-depression scores were lower, and PTGI scores were higher in both groups than before (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): The empowerment psychological intervention led by specialist nurses applied to ICU patients with PTSD can improve their psychological resilience and sleep quality, reduce negative emotions, alleviate clinical symptoms, and promote post-traumatic growth.

N2  - Introduction: Optimal mental state and physical fitness are crucial factors affecting training of military personnel. Incorporating components aimed at improving mental status and physical composition of soldiers into training programmes can lead to better outcomes. Previously, cold exposure has been used to promote human health in multiple ways, with a plethora of reported benefits. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of regular cold exposure on the psychological status and physical composition of healthy young soldiers in the Czech Army. Method(s): A total of 49 (male and female) soldiers aged 19-30 years were randomly assigned to one of the two groups (intervention and control). The participants regularly underwent cold exposure for 8 weeks, in outdoor and indoor environments. Life Satisfaction Questionnaire and InBody 770 device were used to evaluate life satisfaction and body composition, respectively. Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale was used to assess anxiety produced by cold exposure. Result(s): Theoretical and practical training in cold immersion in the winter did not induce anxiety. Regular cold exposure led to a significant (p=0.045) increase of 6.2% in self-perceived sexual satisfaction compared with the pre-exposure measurements. Furthermore, considerable increase (6.3% compared with the pre-exposure period) was observed in self-perceived health satisfaction; the change was borderline significant (p=0.052). In men, there was a reduction in waist circumference (1.3%, p=0.029) and abdominal fat (5.5%, p=0.042). Systematic exposure to cold significantly lowered perceived anxiety in the entire test group (p=0.032). Conclusion(s): Cold water exposure can be recommended as an addition to routine military training regimens. Regular exposure positively impacts mental status and physical composition, which may contribute to the higher psychological resilience. Additionally, cold exposure as a part of military training is most likely to reduce anxiety among soldiers.Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. No commercial re-use.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Dental anxiety and pain pose serious problems for both patients and dentists. One of the most stressful and frightening dental procedures for patients is dental implant surgery; that even hearing its name causes them stress. Virtual reality (VR) distraction is an effective intervention used by healthcare professionals to help patients cope with unpleasant procedures. Our aim is to evaluate the use of high-quality VR and natural environments on dental implant patients to determine the effect on reducing pain and anxiety. METHOD(S): Seventy-three patients having two dental implant surgeries participated in a randomized controlled trial. One surgery was with VR, and one was without. Anxiety was measured with the the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale tests. The pain was measured with the Numerical Rating Scales. Patient satisfaction, surgeon distress, memory vividness, and time perception were evaluated. Physiological data were collected with biofeedback and neurofeedback device. RESULT(S): VR effectively reduced anxiety and pain compared to no VR. Physiological data validated the questionnaire results. Patient satisfaction increased, with 90.4% willing to reuse VR. VR reduced time perception and memory vividness. CONCLUSION(S): Psychometric and psychophysiological assessments showed that VR successfully reduced patient pain and anxiety. More dental clinicians should use VR technology to manage patient anxiety and pain.Copyright Â© 2024. The Author(s).

N2  - GOAL: This study reports an analysis of the concept of trauma-informed professional development as it applies to staff nurses in health care organizations. BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for interventions to protect staff nurses from the psychological impact of traumatic events. By integrating the principles of trauma-informed care into professional development practices, nursing professional development practitioners have a unique opportunity to support nurses and help to promote recovery from trauma-related mental health outcomes. Data were obtained from a content searching service. METHOD(S): Walker and Avant's approach to concept analysis was used (2019). RESULT(S): An operational definition of the concept of trauma-informed professional development as applied to staff nurses in health care organizations was developed. Potential benefits include staff nurse well-being, empowerment, resilience, and enhanced competency. Potential consequences for health care organizations include increased staff morale and retention. CONCLUSION(S): By applying trauma-informed professional development activities, nursing professional development practitioners can minimize negative consequences when teaching topics that could unintentionally adversely affect some participants.

N2  - Background: Oral and maxillofacial surgery is a discipline that focuses on surgical treatment and realizes the prevention and treatment of oral organs, facial soft tissues, maxillofacial and maxillofacial bones, mandibles, zygomatic bones, salivary glands and neck diseases. Oral and maxillofacial surgery is becoming more and more mature, and great progress and optimization have been made in the classification of oral and maxillofacial surgical diseases, as well as in the composition, diagnosis and treatment. Since the reform and opening up, my country's economic level has been further improved, people's quality of life has been improved, and more people have begun to pay attention to the solution of oral problems. Therefore, the psychological response and nursing work of oral and maxillofacial surgery patients have become hot topic of discussion among scholars. Objective(s): Generally speaking, oral and maxillofacial surgery patients will face a series of physiological changes such as facial shape changes, difficulty eating, and slurred speech after surgery. Such conditions are likely to cause a series of negative emotions in oral and maxillofacial surgery patients, such as anxiety, Irritability, fear, etc. Negative psychological reactions will not only affect the follow-up treatment effect, but also hinder the orderly development of nursing work. Therefore, in order to completely solve such problems, it is necessary to fully grasp the psychological characteristics and psychological characteristics of oral and maxillofacial surgery patients. Therefore, targeted nursing measures can be taken to eliminate the resistance of patients, adapt to the changes brought about by the operation more quickly, and keep a positive and optimistic attitude all the time. Subjects and methods: This article will take the oral and maxillofacial surgery patients admitted to a local hospital as the research object. There are 110 patients in total, including 57 male patients and 53 female patients. The age of the patients is generally between 40 and 75 years old. All patients were equally divided into two groups, and there was no significant difference in gender and age between the two groups, which were comparable. Finally, the psychological reactions of the patients were observed, and targeted psychological interventions were implemented. According to psychological indicators, blood pressure changes and other data, the specific Treatment results. After a period of observation, it can be seen that most of the psychological reactions of oral and maxillofacial surgery patients are: fear. There is a certain sense of despair and depression. The treatment cost of oral and maxillofacial diseases is high, which will cause a serious economic burden to some families. Many patients will worry that they will become a burden to the family, which will lead to negative and self-blaming emotions; pessimism and disappointment , Since oral and maxillofacial surgery will bring many changes to patients' eating habits and communication methods, many patients will lose confidence in their future life due to changes in living habits; anxiety and irritability, patients after surgical treatment will There are certain restrictions in communicating with others, which will inevitably lead to upset emotions, and due to the local pain caused by the postoperative catheter, it will also cause patients to have anxiety and even conflict with nursing work. In order to help oral and maxillofacial surgery patients quickly get out of the postoperative trauma and adjust their psychological state in a timely manner, medical staff need to take the following nursing measures: First, create a good hospital environment for the patients, and make a comprehensive introduction to the hospital, so that the patients can adapt to the new situation as soon as possible. environment to reduce the pressure of diagnosis and treatment; the second is to accurately analyze the patient's psychological characteristics, and strengthen communication and exchanges with patients; the third is to carry out education for family members, teach them how to comfort patients, and clarify the patients' true thoughts and actual demands; It is necessary to improve the professional ability of nursing staff, enrich the knowledge reserve, and minimize the pain caused by nursing to patients; the fifth is to respect the individual rights of patients, guide patients to use auxiliary methods to express their opinions, and introduce medical development trends, so as to give patients Hope to keep a positive attitude. Result(s): According to the actual survey, the anxiety and depression levels of the patients before nursing intervention were 18.2 and 17.6, respectively, and after the nursing intervention, the anxiety and depression levels were 6.1 and 5.9, respectively, and the patient satisfaction was as high as 98.2, which proves that the relevant methods are feasible, can play a role in reducing the psychological burden of patients. Conclusion(s): Due to the lack of professional disease knowledge in oral and maxillofacial surgery patients, when faced with unknown diseases, it is inevitable that there will be negative emotions such as fear and anxiety, which will not only affect normal life and rest, but also further aggravate the disease, which is not conducive to follow-up treatment development of work. Therefore, in order to help patients to actively receive health treatment and recover from the disease as soon as possible, the relevant nursing staff, doctors and nutritionists should fully combine the actual situation of the patients, adopt personalized nursing methods, accurately grasp the psychological characteristics and reactions of different patients, and clearly According to the actual needs of the patients, through a series of psychological interventions, the patients' awareness of the disease can be strengthened, a good nurse-patient relationship can be created, the treatment effect can be maximized, and the emotional state of the patients can be effectively improved.

T1  - ANALYSIS ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE ELDERLY IN COMMUNITY AND THE MENTAL NEEDS OF COMMUNITY NURSING

N2  - Background: With the development of economy and scientific progress, human beings have greatly reduced the population mortality and increased the average life expectancy of the population through planned immunization, improved nutrition and food supply and effective treatment of diseases. The aging of the population is becoming more and more serious. According to statistics, by 2014, the total number of elderly people aged 60 and over had reached 212.42 million, breaking the 15% mark for the first time, accounting for 15.53% of the total number in China. It is predicted that by 2049, the number of elderly people aged 60 and over in China will reach 36.5%. As one of the key social groups, the elderly, with the growth of age, the transformation of social roles, the change of mental needs and other factors, the functions of various tissues and organs of the body gradually decline, the social adaptability is also gradually reduced, and various health problems are highlighted. Most elderly people have the phenomenon of sub-health and illness. According to the current mainstream pension model in China, the vast majority of the elderly live in the community. Therefore, it is the top priority of community nursing to actively carry out community elderly mental nursing and improve the self -care ability and quality of life of the elderly. Objective(s): With the development of China's social economy, people's living standards have gradually improved, and the number of elderly population has also increased sharply. With the growth of age, the health status and various functions of the elderly gradually decline. At the same time, some elderly people lack the care and care of their children. Therefore, they are facing some problems in life and health, such as mental problems, medical care of diseases and life care. Relevant studies have found that physical health, family interpersonal relationship and quality of life satisfaction play an important role in regulating the mental status of the elderly. Subjects and methods: 1. Current situation of community nursing for the elderly. Health archives community medical personnel establish dynamic electronic health archives for the elderly in their jurisdiction by means of telephone follow-up, door-to-door follow-up and outpatient examination, which records in detail the health status, medical records, living habits, physical examination, health assessment and other contents, so as to facilitate the medical personnel to fully grasp the health status of the elderly in their jurisdiction, Provide targeted medical care services. Health education. (1) Community medical staff regularly hold simple and practical health knowledge lectures (including health care, healthy diet, mental counseling, etc.) in the area under their jurisdiction; (2) During the free clinic or follow-up, the community medical staff will take the forms of written information publicity and oral Q & A, so that the elderly can benefit from it. Family hospital bed. For patients who need continuous treatment (non dangerous diseases within the scope of admission and can be treated or rehabilitated at home) and cannot seek medical treatment by themselves, a form of setting up hospital beds in their homes according to regulations and regular door-to-door medical care services provided by community medical staff. Including disease treatment and nursing, health education and consultation, prevention and control of disease occurrence and development, etc. To a certain extent, it alleviates the family burden and solves the problem of medical treatment for people with mobility difficulties. However, since the diagnosis and treatment is carried out in families with relatively lack of relevant supporting service facilities, it is inevitable that there are certain risks and hidden dangers, such as allergy during intravenous infusion, respiratory arrest during gastric tube insertion, sudden cardiac death during enema, etc. Family signing. Residents in the jurisdiction have established a long-term and stable service relationship with the community general practitioner team through signing a contract, and the team provides basic medical and public health services to the contracted residents in accordance with national policies. Shanghai took the lead in carrying out the pilot work since 2011 and promoted it nationwide, gradually changing from "coarse and wide" to "fine and fine". On this basis, the contract type family doctor system service was implemented in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province in May 2015. One of the contracted residents was registered as one of the registered residence elderly. After signing the contract, ten preferential services covering basic medical, public health and personalized health management were included, including family bed service priority. During the signing year, we will provide one visit free of charge to the elderly who are inconvenient to move and have real needs among the signing residents, provide whole process health management services for patients with chronic diseases, issue health diagnosis reports once a year free of charge, and provide personalized health management suggestions. The service fee is 150 yuan per capita per year, of which 50 yuan is borne by individuals. 2. Problems in community nursing for the elderly. Lack of effective policy support. In China, the community nursing model started late and developed slowly. There is neither a clear legal provision for community elderly care, such as Japan, nor a special appropriation set by the Australian federal government for the "family and community care project". In addition, due to regional differences and unbalanced allocation of health resources, it is difficult for the community nursing work to develop sustainably and stably. The form of community nursing for the elderly is single. The existing community nursing service only follows the management mode of the hospital. China's community free clinic service is still patient-centered, and its work is limited to blood pressure measurement, intravenous infusion, intramuscular injection, drug delivery, physical examination, etc. according to the investigation of helun, it is found that at present, China's community free clinic work is still dominated by disease nursing, and less involved in disease prevention and health promotion. According to relevant reports, most countries in the world have carried out community elderly care according to their own characteristics to solve the medical and health care problems caused by aging, gradually formed service models such as hospitals, community nursing institutions and family nursing institutions, and established a network system integrating disease care, preventive health care and life care. There is a shortage of community nursing talents for the elderly. China does not pay enough attention to the training of community nursing talents. At present, there is no school in China to train special elderly nursing talents. There is a lack of targeted practical skill training, and the theoretical knowledge is superficial. Moreover, most nurses working in the community generally have the problems of low educational back - ground, weak professional knowledge and operation skills, and low mastery of communication skills , In addition, due to the lack of systematic and professional community nursing training for the elderly, many nurses do not understand the needs of the elderly. The care provided for the elderly is limited to general life care and medical care, but can not reflect the full-time care and support for the elderly, and the service is not in place. At the same time, most community nurses are temporary workers, resulting in the instability of the nursing team, It causes some difficulties for the long-term and effective development of community nursing work. Result(s): 1. Increase government attention. Government departments and health administrative departments should increase their support for community nursing for the elderly, fully realize that accelerating the development process of community nursing for the elderly is the general trend, do a good job in guidance, promote the construction of community nursing for the elderly, establish and improve community nursing related systems.

T1  - CULTURE OF EMPATHY AND CREATIVE PSYCHOPHARMACOTHERAPY: THE BACKGROUND OF HIGH-QUALITY PATIENTS CARE
T3  - 10th Croatian Congress on Psychopharmacotherapy. Dubrovnik Croatia.
A1  - Jakovljevic M. 
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - The basic intention of this presentation is to promote culture of empathy in both academic and clinical medicine through the concept of the transdisciplinary integrative psychiatry and empathology. Empathy is a basic human capacity which manifests itself in different ways in different cultures, contexts, life scripts and stories. Lack of empathy, empathic gaps, misperception of the others or dyspathy causes problems in communication, education, personal growth and psychosocial development, private and business relationships. Empathy disorders and dyspathy are related to many psycho-social problems such as child abuse, divorces, violation of human rights, crime, violence, war, etc. as well as to many mental disorders like schizophrenia, psychopathies, particularly antisocial personality disorders, depression, autism, etc. Empathy now is a common term in many scientific and humanistic disciplines that is defined in different ways and used with diverse meanings, for example as basic human trait, capacity, ability, skill, state of mind, way of being in the world, basic human instinct, need, virtue, transformative force. It can be conflated with sympathy, compassion, theory of mind, mentalization, emotional resonance, identification, etc. According Judith Orloff empathy is the medicine the world needs, but it seems that empathy is also the medicine that the modern, both academic and clinical medicine need. Transformation of medicine from a vocation to a profession characterized by objectification, standardization, treatment guidelines and commodification and now more and more to a trade as narrow and rigid system associated with a cold, detached and dehumanized healthcare opens the question of importance, definition and application of clinical empathy. Within the mainstream culture of evidence-based medicine cold, objective and emotionally detached concern was an idealized white-coated concern, in which by refraining from emotional contamination, physicians would gain therapeutic power and be rational. Culture of empathy may help in improving the culture of medicine which is associated with dramatically higher rate of the burn-out syndrome among physicians and students of medicine compared to other professions. Culture represents the implicit widely accepted essential beliefs, values, norms and behavior of a community and within community and it provides identity, meaning, purpose, order, and stability. To be an agent of positive transformation, empathic communication needs to be a lifestyle practiced daily. It is intentional response which involves three steps: matching/mirroring, positive validation and pacing rapport in order to achieve therapeutic goals. Empathic communication or emphatization is a cornerstone of education and good clinical practice in medicine. Empathy facilitates trust, disclosure, respect and collaboration and can be directly therapeutic. According to Karl Jaspers empathy is an interpretative and diagnostic tool in psychiatry, a method of observation of mental states, an important component of therapy that is vital for the quality of therapeutic relationship and establishing therapeutic alliance. Empathy has cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions so that we can speak about empathic thinking or perspective taking (understanding the patient as a person - cognitive empathy), empathic feeling for and with the patient (emotional empathy) and empathic assertiveness to respond by helping and supporting the patient (behavioral empathy). Therapeutic empathy is based on the empathic narrative and is represented as an active narrative process in which the therapist is construing and expressing the inner emotional logic of the patient's problem patterns. Modern psychopharmacotherapy, glorified by some as a background of successful treatment in psychiatry and vilified by others as toxic and non-sufficiently effective is hot and controversial topic. This presentation addresses the culture of empathy within the concept of creative, person-centered narrative psychopharmacotherapy (CP-CNP). CP-CNP involves not only creative and rational use of mental health medicines but it is also about application of empathic communication to establish therapeutic context, to help patients restore psychobiological basis of their resilience and anti-fragility, to increase their placebo, and decrease nocebo response to medicines, to change old ill narrative and create new positive, full recovery narrative and new life story supporting their creativity, emphatization and self-actualization. Empathy based on love represents a way of creative, sensitive and meaningful being in the world and makes being a physician more effective, meaningful and satisfying. It is a vital quality of civilized life and values-based medicine and a powerful agent of positive transformation when practiced daily.

N2  - Background: Teachers are the foundation and source of education. As the main undertaker of school education, teachers' mental health not only affects their own development, but also relates to the teaching quality and work results, and has an important impact on the growth and development of students. According to the survey results of the white paper on mental health of Chinese urban residents, 73.6% of the people in China are in a state of mental sub-health, 16.1% of the people have psychological problems to varying degrees, while only 10.3% of the people are in mental health. The outline of the healthy China 2030 plan even clearly requires that the construction of mental health service system should be strengthened, and new business forms of health services should be encouraged. At the beginning of 2019, the Institute of psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the social sciences literature press jointly released the report on the development of Chinese national mental health (2017-2018). The report points out that the mental health level of teachers in China is declining year by year. The main psychological problems are depression and anxiety. The mental health status of primary and secondary school teachers is worse than that of the general national group, and the mental health status of primary school teachers is even worse. The COVID-19, which began in 2020, has exacerbated people's original mental health problems. During the COVID-19, the demand for mental health care has increased significantly, and tens of thousands of people are suffering from anxiety, loneliness, depression and other emotions caused by isolation. Subjects and methods: This study began to issue questionnaires in January 2021, lasted for one year, and ended in January 2022. The primary and secondary school teachers in Huanggang City, Hubei Province, including primary school, junior high school, ordinary high school and vocational high school teachers, were randomly selected from three towns (districts) in each county and city to participate in the survey. The schools were equally sampled from rural, town and urban schools. Each school arranged school administrators, subject teachers, psychological counseling teachers and head teachers to participate in the survey. A total of 1848 valid data were collected in this survey. Result(s): The overall situation of teachers' mental health. According to the screening criteria of the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), if the total score is greater than or equal to 160 points, or the factor score is greater than or equal to 2 points, or the number of positive questions is greater than or equal to 43, and if any of these criteria is met, then there is a mental health problem. The higher the total score or factor score of mental health or the number of positive items, the greater the possibility of problems. Conclusion(s): First, teachers' psychological problems have been at a high incidence stage. The survey results show that the detection rate of teachers' psychological problems is 40.37%, which is significantly higher than that of the general population. The mental health status of divorced teachers is worse than that of married and unmarried teachers, and they tend to have various psychological problems. Primary school teachers' obsessive-compulsive disorder is more obvious than other teachers, while junior middle school teachers' tendency of psychological problems is higher. Ordinary teachers are more likely to have psychological problems. The head teachers have more obvious anxiety and terror, and are more likely to have psychological problems. Taking the total SCL-90 scores of 1025 teachers with positive screening as independent variables and other factors as dependent variables, the results showed that the mental health level of teachers was affected by the following factors. Specifically, the mental health level was affected by the score well-being. The more life events, the less resources to actively deal with, the more repressed personality, passive or perfectionism, the weaker social support, the greater the pressure, and the lower the level of mental health. Second, the construction of teachers' well-being needs to focus on specific groups. The survey results show that the overall level of teachers' well-being is good, but 31.63% of them still feel unhappy. Among them, teachers aged 21-30 feel unhappy. Unmarried and divorced teachers feel unhappy. Middle school and vocational school teachers feel unhappy. The findings suggest that the construction of teachers' wellbeing should focus on young teachers, unmarried and divorced teachers, as well as teachers in junior and vocational middle schools. Thirdly, job burnout has appeared among some teachers. 10.71% of them had obvious job burnout. Among them, female teachers are more prone to job burnout. With the increase of age, job burnout showed a downward trend. The job burnout of rural teachers is more serious than that of township teachers. Ordinary teachers' job burnout is the most serious. Class teachers are more inclined to appear job burnout. Fourth, the sleep quality of teachers needs to be improved. The results showed that the incidence of sleep problems in teachers was 40.02%. The proportion of sleep disorders above moderate level was 10.95%. This part of the population may have the phenomenon of sleep disorder, which is manifested as follows: long sleep latency; sleep reversal, biological clock disorder; wake up early and frequently. First, you can't go to sleep after waking up. Second, you wake up more often at night, and it takes a long time to go back to sleep each time. Hypothetical insomnia, a small number of people actually sleep well, because of the impact of psychological factors, they think that their sleep status is poor. Among them, primary and junior middle school teachers are more likely to have sleep problems. Fifth, teachers' stress needs systematic coordination. The results showed that 16.74% of teachers felt too much pressure. Among them, teachers aged 31-40 had the greatest self-pressure, followed by those aged 41-50. Ordinary teachers feel the most pressure. The self-feeling pressure of head teachers is greater than that of non-head teachers. These teachers may be influenced by life events in family, work, interpersonal, economic and other aspects, and have passive, repressive and perfectionist tendencies in personality traits. Regression analysis was used to investigate the effects of stressors (life events), coping styles and other factors on stress and mental health. The results are shown in Figure 1.

T1  - RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STUDENTS' POSITIVE AND HEALTHY PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HEALTHY CHINA
T3  - 2022 Symposium on Mental Health of Citizens in Pacific Rim Nations, MHCPRN 2022. Zhangjiajie China.
A1  - Ma C. 
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background: How to seize the opportunity and strengthen college students' health education under the background of healthy China strategy is a new challenge and requirement for colleges and universities. Colleges and universities should actively carry out and strengthen health education for college students, vigorously promote the health concept of trinity of physical health, mental health and environmental adaptation, establish the grand health concept of "everyone is health and health is everyone", maintain and improve the comprehensive health level of college students, avoid or reduce the infection of various diseases, and prevent the emergence or spread of infectious diseases on campus, This is of far-reaching significance to the realization of disease prevention and control. Mental health is an important dimension of human health. The World Health Organization clearly put forward in its charter in 1948 that health is not only the absence of disease or weakness, but also the intact state of physical, mental and social adaptation. College students are in the period of psychological transformation, and their body and mind are not yet fully mature. Due to academic tension and various negative effects such as uncertainty, the probability of mental health problems of students is greatly increased, resulting in some students' psychological obstacles or abnormalities of varying degrees, such as worry, fear, anxiety, lack of sense of security, divine depression and so on. In this regard, it is necessary to conduct psychological counseling for the huge special group of college students, strengthen students' mental health education and prevention and control awareness, and urge students to scientifically and correctly understand the relationship between their psychological state, behavior and health. It is the top priority for colleges and universities to establish a mental health education strategy with certain characteristics in line with college students' cognition. Objective(s): The outline of the "healthy China 2030" plan is a major measure to protect people's health. The term "healthy China 2030" has been mentioned in many places. It pays attention to actively publicizing and carrying forward the concept of healthy China with health as the core, which shows that China attaches great importance to health construction. By attaching importance to physical education and health courses in Colleges and universities, we can help college students cultivate good sports motivation and participation interest, establish lifelong sports awareness and sports habits, and expand educational vision and thinking; It is beneficial to improve the quality of physical education teaching in the university stage; It is beneficial to improve the physical quality of college students; It is conducive to cultivating college students' positive and healthy psychology; It is conducive to ensuring the comprehensive psychological and physical health of college students. Therefore, college physical education and health curriculum is of great significance to the development of College Students' psychological and physical health. The National Health Assembly stressed that without the protection of national health, there would be no realization of the first Centennial goal of a well-off society in an allround way. We will continue to focus on people's physical and mental health, improve the health system and education system, improve the level of medical and health care and education, build a comprehensive health ecosystem, vigorously develop health and education, accelerate the comprehensive construction and implementation of the healthy China strategy, and lay a solid foundation for realizing the goals of the "two centenaries" and the Chinese dream. The outline of "healthy China 2030" plan released in 2016 emphasizes the popularization of healthy life, the optimization of health services, the improvement of health and safety level, the creation of a healthy environment and the development of health undertakings. Take health as the top priority of the development strategy, and integrate the health concept into the policy, so as to lay a solid and healthy foundation for the realization of the Chinese dream. It also advocates strengthening the development of health education in Colleges and universities, bringing health education into China's education system, making health education an important part of universal education, establishing and perfecting the promotion mechanism of health education in Colleges and universities, and establishing a health education model combining education and teaching. College Physical Education and health curriculum is an important link in building a healthy China. Focusing on the development of college students, adhering to the concept of health first, stimulating college students' interest in sports, cultivating college students' good physical exercise habits and lifelong sports awareness, so as to improve college students' physical and mental health, Finally, promote the healthy growth of College Students' physical and mental health. The healthy development of college students includes physical health and mental health. At present, we should do a good job in Physical Education in Colleges and universities, bring college physical education into the strategic positioning of building a healthy China, attach great importance to college students' physical and mental health, and truly integrate the teaching goal of jointly improving physical and mental health into the teaching goal of physical education and health courses in Colleges and universities, To achieve a new model of thinking and reform and the combination of education and health has become the primary goal of China's health strategy in the new era. Subjects and methods: On the basis of establishing psychological counseling institutions, colleges and universities should add students' mental health supervisors in classes or dormitories, have a close understanding of students' psychological dynamics in an all-round way, focus on prevention, and gradually form an effective prevention mechanism for psychological problems, so as to provide timely help and multi-channel psychological counseling for college students with mental health problems, and take care of the hearts of college students. At the same time, we should take various infectious disease crises that may occur on campus as an opportunity for mental health education, improve the mental health education system in combination with the daily education and teaching work of the school, actively carry out mental health training, organize mental health education activities, and increase the publicity and education of the prevention knowledge of various common infectious diseases. Formulate effective psychological counseling programs and effectively carry out diversified psychological support methods. Starting from reality, we should strengthen college students' mental health education, emotional education and personality education by combining individual counseling with group counseling and combining online and offline, so as to continuously develop college students' sound personality. We should enhance college students' cognition of mental health problems, adjust college students' psycho - logical adaptability, enhance self-cultivation, cultivate healthy mentality, cultivate college students' good interpersonal relations, improve students' self-awareness and self-regulation level, and then enhance their psychological quality, make psychological activities harmonious and unified with the external environment, and maintain and promote individual mental health. Class teachers and counselors should patiently do students' ideological work, help students correctly screen scientific and objective disease and epidemic prevention information from the network, improve their mental health awareness, and enable students to face diseases and epidemic situations with positive and effective psychological activities and normal and stable mentality. In order to make students actively adapt to the current social environment, colleges and universities should create a positive psychological education atmosphere and a healthy learning environment, so as to promote the healthy development of college students.

N2  - Introduction: Mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) can be considered a useful strategy for coping with psychotic experiences, helping patients to respond differently to psychotic symptoms with a more conscious acceptance of thoughts, emotions and sensations. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and potential clinical utility of a mindfulness-based intervention. Method(s): Twenty outpatients from a Mental Health Centre in Bari approached to participate in this study. Among the approached participants, 15 agreed to participate and provided data at pretreatment, among them only 10 completed the treatment protocol and provided data after the treatment. Patients were offered mindfulness-based psychoeducation intervention protocol (MBPP) proposed by Chien and Lee (2013). The structure of the program consisted of 8-week 120 min weekly group sessions. Outcome assessments were conducted at recruitment (time 0) and after mindfulness-based psychoeducation program (time 1). In order to compare scores at different times (T0 and T1), paired T-test was used, if normal distribution, or Exact Wilcoxon signed rank test; normal distribution was analyzed using Shapiro-Wilk test. Result(s): The results obtained after the administration of the following rating scales Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Drug attitude Inventory (DAI-10), Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS), Schedule for the assessment of the insight (SAI), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) show score variations at two times. MAAS and SAI show a significant increase at time 1 compared to time 0. Conclusion(s): The data obtained with this study highlight the feasibility of mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) in psychotic spectrum disorders in Community Mental Health Services. Our study underline furthermore the opportunity of mindfulness-based interventions to increase insight in a recovery-oriented rehabilitation process.Copyright Â© 2023 Medicinska Naklada Zagreb.

T1  - Effectiveness of psychosocial interventions on the psychological outcomes of parents with preterm infants: A systematic review and meta-analysis
A1  - Chan S.H.
A1  - Shorey S. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Parents of preterm infants are often thrown unexpectedly into the care of their vulnerable infant, causing them to be stressed and overwhelmed. Social support has been previously highlighted as a crucial factor in helping parents cope with stress. Several psychosocial interventions have thus been developed to support parents of preterm babies, which warrant further investigations. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in reducing stress (primary outcome), anxiety, depression, pediatric medical traumatic stress (PMTS) and increasing social support among parents with preterm infants. METHOD(S): A systematic-review and meta-analysis were conducted. Eight electronic databases were searched for relevant studies from their respective inception dates till September 2023. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan, using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was investigated using Cochran Q and I2 tests, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Subgroup analyses were conducted for follow-up measurement, gender of parent, type of intervention provider, and setting. FINDINGS: Eighteen studies were included in this review, and all studies were meta-analysed. Participants who received psychosocial interventions reported significantly lower stress and depression in comparison to control group participants. Psychosocial interventions delivered by psychologists and trained researchers were more effective compared to the nurses. The GRADE assessment indicated that the certainty of evidence for all outcomes were very low. CONCLUSION(S): Psychosocial interventions effectively reduce stress and depression levels in parents with preterm infants. Our findings encourage the implementation of psychosocial interventions to improve parental psychological wellbeing. Future higher quality trials are needed to measure psychological outcomes among parents, especially fathers.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - High levels of stress and burnout, low help-seeking behaviour and unhealthy coping in healthcare professionals (HCPs), are a critical concern globally. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) reduce stress, are a healthy coping mechanism and have become increasingly popular among HCPs, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, HCPs' busy schedules require the intervention to be accessible, pragmatic, and context specific. Key to this goal is approaching mindfulness from a multicultural perspective, especially in diverse settings such as Africa. This paper aims to provide practical tips to ensure that the MBI offered is effective with multicultural HCPs during intense stress. Four tips each discuss the curriculum, implementation, and sustainability, respectively. The tips are elucidated by practical examples of regulating stress in healthcare settings and to offer a guideline to help structure future MBIs to be culturally and context appropriate.

N2  - Background/Significance: Pre-dating the COVID-19 pandemic, physician trainees have exhibited elevated rates of burnout (44-55%) and depression (25-35%) compared to the general population. Prompted by the overwhelming stress of the COVID pandemic, in 2020-2021 the New York-Presbyterian House Staff Mental Health Service (HSMHS) at Columbia University Irving Medical Center launched a pilot program to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of 1:1 psychiatrist-run, opt out wellness check-ins for Internal Medicine (IM) residents. In 2021-2022, this pilot was expanded to include 6 additional departments and twice-yearly check-ins. Check-ins offered validation, opportunity to process challenging experiences, and enhance resilience with mental health (MH) clinicians experienced in trainee MH (2 C-L and 3 HSMHS faculty), stigma reduction and linkage to care, and innovative preliminary information in a field with little quantitative literature. Method(s): All trainees received an IRB-approved online survey prior to and at the end of the year (EOY). Check-in participants received an online, 2-question survey shortly after the check-in. Check-in participation was not contingent on research participation. Program leadership scheduled the check-ins, but MH faculty informed trainees of the appointment, including the option to opt-out. Program leadership was blind to trainee participation. Result(s): In the initial pilot, 57% of residents completed the check-in, 36% opted out, with participation equally distributed across PGY levels. The two most common opt-out reasons were engagement in therapy or preference for other wellness activities. 11% of participants were referred to the HSMHS. 96% of participants found the check-in helpful; 99% supported the initiative. In the 2021-2022 multi-departmental pilot 52% of trainees completed the first check-in, 39% completed the second, with 13% overall referred to the HSMHS. 96% of participants found the first check-in helpful, 95% the second. 96% of participants in the first check-in and 100% in the second recommended check-ins become a regular part of the curriculum. 81% felt that check-ins enhanced well-being; even among those who opted out, 87% agreed. 89% agreed check-ins were helpful to process training experiences; 82% appreciated that the check-in was scheduled for them. Ninety percent exceeded the HIGH threshold on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS); PSS scores significantly decreased from pre- to post-survey (p=0.02), although PSS remained HIGH. Some measures of stigma improved. Discussion/Conclusion: Psychiatry-led 1:1 check-ins are both feasible and meaningfully support the well-being of physician trainees. Consultation-liaison psychiatrists, physically present in the hospital and regularly interacting with house staff, are in unique position to be leaders in field of trainee wellness.

T1  - THE REFINED MODEL OF SMART SERVICE-ORIENTED COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE: TAKING THE EMOTIONAL CONTROL OF PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION AS AN EXAMPLE
T3  - Psychology Congress 2021. Virtual.
A1  - Qi Q. 
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Background: According to relevant data from the World Health Organization: By 2020, depression in the elderly will become the second largest human killer after cancer, and 50% to 70% of elderly people will commit suicide due to depression in the elderly. Depression is a mental illness characterized by persistent depression of mood and emotion. Its main characteristics are: persistent depression, slow thinking, decreased volition and accompanying physical symptoms as the main manifestations. If depression cannot be promptly and appropriately dispatched, it will seriously threaten the patient's physical and mental health. The refined model of smart service-oriented community governance is to establish a mental health service station, which uses the community as a unit to maintain and promote the mental health of the residents through relevant theories, methods and techniques of psychology. By vigorously developing community mental health services, the mental health and social adaptability of community residents can be effectively improved, and the occurrence of mental disorders, mental illnesses and abnormal behaviors can be reduced. China's community health services have been in operation for many years, although almost all community doctors believe that the prospects for developing mental health services are very optimistic in terms of economic and social benefits. However, as far as the current development is concerned, the development of community mental health services is relatively lagging and there are many shortcomings. Of course, there are many factors that affect the development of community mental health services. For example, most community health service centers have almost no independent mental health service specialist outpatient clinics, or even some necessary psychological measurement tools; community residents' misunderstanding of psychological problems also leads to Community mental health services have not been paid attention to the important influencing factors of alienation and neglect; in addition, the narrow coverage of mental health services, the single development method and other factors make the development of community mental health services difficult. Therefore, it is very important to build a smart service-oriented community, and at the same time, mental health service personnel should also have the ability to diagnose and treat common psychological problems. Objective(s): In the era of big data, if a smart service-oriented community can be established, negative emotional tendencies can be detected in time, and reading therapy can be implemented for early depression symptoms, it will be of great benefit to maintaining people's mental health and preventing the occurrence of mental illness. Therefore, in-depth research and analysis of the refined model of smart service-oriented community governance can effectively study the emotional control factors of patients with depression, which is of great significance to the analysis of the emotions of patients with depression. Subjects and methods: The influencing factors of depression patients' emotions were analyzed through the refined model of smart service-type community governance, and 500 depression patients were taken as the survey subjects. Using questionnaires to analyze the emotions of patients with depression, it includes three aspects: cognition, emotion and behavior. In the survey results, five levels from 0 to 4 are used to quantify the impact of specific factors. 0 means irrelevant, 1 means slight influence, 2 means normal influence, 3 means obvious influence, and 4 means sufficient influence. Result(s): By analyzing the impact of the smart service-based community management model on patients with depression (shown in Table 1), the effect can be effectively known. The smart service community can effectively integrate resources, comprehensively integrate various information channels, and achieve onestop services for residents, effectively improving the cognitive level of patients with depression; through harmonious overall planning and refined management, it can collect residents' information This kind of data is used to analyze the mood of patients with depression; through benign interaction, a communication circle is formed within the community, so that patients with depression can integrate into the community, improve their behavioral expression ability, and realize the organization and management of the community Conclusion(s): The research on the refined model of smart service-oriented community governance proposed in this article, on the one hand, has created a new direction that keeps pace with the times for controlling the mood of patients with depression in practice. By extracting keywords related to cognition, emotion, and behavior in the unconscious state of depression patients for feature analysis, it can objectively and accurately reflect the symptoms of depression, and then formulate corresponding community management programs for symptoms. At the same time, patients with potential depression can be detected in advance, and they can grasp the opportunity of treatment when the patients initially show depressive symptoms, which conforms to the principle of disease prevention in Chinese medicine, and achieves the effect of disease treatment and disease prevention.

N2  - Background: In recent years, the incidence of infertility has shown an increasing trend, mainly due to the impact of factors such as diet, life and work stress on women. Moreover, infertile patients often have to face pressure from family, society and other aspects, which will greatly increase their psychological burden. In serious cases, it will lead to depression, even the idea of suicide, and seriously reduce their quality of life. Female infertile patients have different degrees of depression, which not only bring psychological burden to the individual, but also affect the physiological level, aggravate the depression, and even progress to mental disease. In recent years, with the opening of social concept and the increase of life pressure, the number of female infertility patients has increased significantly. Infertility is not conducive to a solid relationship between husband and wife, increased the risk of family division. Under the current background of declining fertility rate, infertility results in infertility, which has negative effects on the population structure and social operation in the future. At present, assisted reproductive technology has been developed rapidly, and the success rate of infertility treatment has increased significantly. However, depression is not conducive to various types of assisted reproductive technology to achieve the desired effect. Psychotherapy, also known as psychotherapy, is different from chemistry, natural medicine and physical therapy. It is a method that doctors use language to influence the psychological activities of patients in the process of communication between them. Psychotherapy uses psychological methods to train, educate and treat patients through verbal or non-verbal factors to alleviate or eliminate physical symptoms, improve mental state and adapt to family, social and work environments. Objective(s): With the continuous opening of social concept and the increase of life pressure, infertility has become increasingly serious in recent years. Infertility has seriously affected family relations and is one of the main causes of family division. Especially female infertile patients, not only to bear the pressure from the family, but also in the traditional concept of the role of the surrounding environment will be criticized, there is a widespread serious depression. The development of assisted reproductive technology brings hope to female infertile patients. However, the serious depression will aggravate the feeling of frustration, loneliness and guilt in the process of treatment and affect the effect of treatment. Therefore, mastering the depression status of female infertile patients and analyzing the influencing factors of depression are conducive to targeted intervention to improve the pregnancy probability. Subjects and methods: This research mainly discuss the psychotherapy in the female infertility clinical treatment the effect. Study design: Pay attention to protect the privacy of patients. Most infertile patients will have negative feelings for their own dignity and are extremely sensitive to the surrounding things and words. Nurses must fully respect the privacy of each patient, and obtain the consent of patients when communicating and asking, so as to ensure the smooth completion of nursing work. The improvement of coping styles before and after nursing in the two groups was observed, including submission, face and avoidance. The psychological and emotional changes of 100 female infertility patients were analyzed, and the effects of psychotherapy on depressive psychological disorders of female infertility patients were counted. Method(s): From January 2019 to November 2020, 100 cases of female infertile patients were randomly divided into two groups. Observation group 50 cases, control group 50 cases, and the two groups have comparable data (P > 0.05). The control group received routine nursing care. Patients in the observation group were given psychological nursing: patient guidance to relax the patient's body and mind as much as possible. If infertile patients have bad emotions, they can take relaxation training, emotional conditioning, such as inhalation, you can clench your fist, and exhalation, you need to relax the body and mind play music can also produce the same clinical effect. In terms of diet, nurses should urge infertile patients to eat foods high in vitamins, protein and digestible foods. Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) was used to evaluate psychic depression, physiological depression and HAMD score of infertile patients before and after nursing. Effect of statistical psychotherapy on depressive psychological disorder of female infertility. Result(s): In this survey, the influence value of specific factors is 0-4, which means irrelevant, 1 means slight influence, 2 means general influence, 3 means obvious influence, and 4 means full influence. In order to reduce the great error caused by individual subjectivity in the evaluation, the evaluation value of 100 female infertile patients shall be rounded off and the result shall be determined by means of average. The specific statistical table is shown in Table 1. (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): Female infertile patients generally have different degrees of depression, but most of them are mild depression. Depression is related to many factors, and comprehensive intervention should be provided to female infertile patients. The results show that psychotherapy can significantly reduce the psychic depression, physiological depression and HAMD score of infertile patients, and can also reduce the yield score and avoidance score. To sum up, psychotherapy can effectively reduce the degree of depression of infertile patients and improve their coping styles.

Medical gymnastics can be systemic, local, or a combination of systemic and local. Apparatus may be used in medical gymnastics and may also be unarmed. Divided into active movement, that is, the use of patients themselves actively, passive movement is the use of external forces to increase the range of motion and muscle strength joints. External forces include the healthy side of the body, the strength of others or the strength of the instrument. Medical gymnastics can be used to prevent diseases, to promote health, and to treat injuries and diseases. According to the characteristics, functional conditions and therapeutic purposes of diseases and injuries, appropriate medical gymnastics can be selected for training. You can choose different ways, such as muscle strength training, joint activity training, endurance training, relaxation training, breathing training, balance exercise and so on. About the movement quantity, the movement intensity, the movement scope, should according to the patient to the movement tolerance situation, promptly give the adjustment. Also, may carry on the training in stages according to the condition and the situation. Aerobic training is a kind of endurance training aiming at increasing the ability of breathing, transporting and using oxygen. It is also to improve aerobic metabolism of the body fitness methods. This kind of training method is simple, easy, the movement way is not high to the skill request, is easy to carry out, its movement way has walks, the gymnastics, the swimming, the bicycle, runs in situ, ascends the stairs, skips rope and so on.

N2  - Background: Preschool children between 3 and 6 years old are the key period of psychological development, growth and personality formation, which is characterized by strong plasticity, but is extremely immature in psychological development, low level of self-regulation and self-control, weak self-awareness, and easy to form unhealthy psychology and personality under the influence of environment and adverse factors. The mental health of preschool children will have a profound impact on their cognition, emotion, personality, moral development and social adaptation. At present, due to the influence of traditional education concepts, culture and other factors, ignorance of the cultivation of healthy psychology and personality of young children has led to widespread problems among children, such as poor independence, psychological vulnerability, fear of hardship and fear of difficulties, willfulness, lack of care for people, lack of creativity, lack of awareness and ability of cooperation and communication, and poor self-control. Many children also have various psychological and behavioral deviations, such as loneliness, aggressive behavior, timidity, hyperactivity, sucking fingers, and emotional disorders. This situation, if not taken seriously, is bound to affect the development of young children. Preschool education, as the basis of national quality education, should lay a good foundation for the development of children's mental health and personality. Therefore, my garden of children's mental health education conducted a related exploration and research, while attaching importance to children's physical health, but also have opened a prelude to children's mental health education. Objective(s): In recent years, the incidence of schizophrenia is on the rise, there is no effective cure plan, and the disease has a high recurrence rate, long course and so on. The longer the course of disease and the more times of recurrence, the worse the prognosis of patients, and the heavier the burden of caring for the family members of patients. But most family members cannot vent the bad mood effectively, forms a series of psychological problems finally. Studies have shown that people with schizophrenia are not optimistic about their family members' mental health, and they are more prone to depression and anxiety. They can improve their family members' negative emotions by strengthening their family members' correct understanding of schizophrenia and helping them learn necessary stress management skills. Subjects and methods: 50 patients with schizophrenia in a mental health center were divided into study group and control group by random number-table method, 25 cases in each group. There was no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05) in sex, age and other general data. The control group was given routine health education, including family health education, explain the symptoms of mental illness, clinical manifestations and control methods, medication, prognosis and so on. The researchers gave kindergarten mental health education on the basis of the control group. (1) Cognitive nursing: the psychiatrist and the responsible nurse shall explain to the family members the relevant professional knowledge on mental diseases and the matters needing attention so as to enable them to have a full understanding of the knowledge system of mental diseases. Monthly health education lectures shall be organized for family members. Through group discussions, lectures, interviews and other forms, various knowledge about mental diseases shall be explained, such as the cause, incidence, type, inducing factors, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, prognosis, treatment methods, etc. of mental diseases, so as to inform family members of how to discover and observe the early symptoms of patients, guide each family member on how to deal with and prevent the adverse reactions caused by antipsychotics, repeatedly emphasize the importance of taking medicine on time and returning to hospital for referral, guide family members to treat patients' diseases with a positive, optimistic and correct attitude, and improve family members' compliance with medical treatment. (2) Psychological education: medical personnel shall do a good job in the role of listener, express understanding and sympathy for the mood of the family members, and do transposition thinking, formulate psychological counseling programs for the psychology of the family members, strengthen the psychological nursing of the family members, and teach them how to vent their negative emotions. (3) Team support: organize family members to participate in outdoor and collective activities, strengthen communication with each other, and encourage family members to communicate with each other when organizing the above activities, so as to establish a relationship of trust that can vent bad emotions to each other and reveal their feelings to each other. At the same time, medical staff can properly participate in family communication and exchange and correct guidance, improve the main care of family members of schizophrenics in the treatment of episodes. Result(s): The psychological state scores of the two groups were compared before and after nursing. There was no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05) in the scores of SCL-90 before and after nursing (P > 0.05), and the scores of SCL-90 after nursing were significantly lower than before nursing, and the study group was significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.05). The behavior of the two groups was compared. The study group's compliance behavior score (6.95 +/- 2.46) was significantly lower than that of the control group (9.54 +/- 3.21), and the difference was statistically significant (t = 5.123, P = 0.000). Conclusion(s): Mental health mainly refers to the mental state and mental activities are normal. In this study, under the active communication, guidance and communication with family members, psychiatrists and duty nurses encouraged family members, increased trust, strengthened affinity between nurses and patients, improved psychological status and behavior of family members, so that patients could get better, long-term effective and stable treatment and return to the society as soon as possible.

N2  - Background: Psychological education is an important content of Ideological and political work in colleges and universities and the basic guarantee for the all-round development of college students. Psychological education is an effective carrier to promote the implementation of the concept of three complete educations. The spirit of humanistic care and the attitude of respect, acceptance, trust, understanding, and empathy are the basis for other educational work. The method of psychological education can also be extended to other educational work. Therefore, laying a good foundation for psychological education is not only a practical starting point for promoting the combination of mental education and moral education, but also a beneficial exploration for comprehensively coordinating the educational resources and forces in all fields of running and running the school, all links of education and teaching, and all aspects of talent training, as well as comprehensively promoting the comprehensive reform of three complete educations. Psychological health education is an important part of ideological and political education in colleges and universities. It is one of the basic principles to strengthen and improve the ideological and political work in colleges and universities. China is in the critical period of building a well-off society in an all-round way. We are closer to the goal of national rejuvenation than at any time in history. Our demand for higher education is more urgent than ever before. Adhering to the party's leadership over Ideological and political work in colleges and universities, guiding ideological values through the whole process and links of education and teaching, mobilizing all staff to participate, and gradually forming a long-term mechanism are the inevitable requirements of Ideological and political education in the new era. It is the need to comprehensively promote quality education and ensure the quality of university talent training. To comprehensively promote quality education, we should adhere to facing all college students, respect the characteristics of students' physical and mental development and the law of education, and create corresponding conditions for students' all-round development. Personnel, process and links are indispensable. Colleges and universities should focus on the key points of university talent training, mobilize all departments, change the situation that student management was only the single line responsibility of the Ministry of learning and work and the Academic Affairs Office in the past, bring professional course teachers and managers other than counselors into the education team, create a good education atmosphere and promote the all-round development of college students. It is the meaning of the development of moral education in colleges and universities in the new era. The development of moral education in colleges and universities is generally good, but there are still some problems, such as formalism, insufficient attention, single methods, lack of effectiveness and so on. Only by giving full play to the educational role of curriculum, scientific research, network and organization, excavating the educational elements contained therein, perfecting the educational mechanism, optimizing the evaluation and incentive mechanism, and mobilizing all staff to participate, pay attention to the whole process and implement it in an all-round way, can we put the moral education work into practice and promote the development of moral education. Objective(s): To clarify the development of psychological education in colleges of traditional Chinese medicine in the new era and provide theoretical guidance under the background of three complete educations. Method(s): Starting from the significance of psychological education in Colleges of traditional Chinese medicine, taking the psychological education in Colleges of traditional Chinese medicine as an example, this paper focuses on the modern transformation of psychological education concept, the expansion of new elements and the construction of system. As the principal role in cultivating and transporting high-quality talents for the development of the country, colleges and universities should focus on making concerted efforts to open up multiple educational channels and upgrade mental health education for students. The educational subjects give full play to their respective strengths at the system level to ensure the smooth development of College Students' mental health education. Formulate corresponding mental health education system, and clearly point out that all teachers and workers of the University have the responsibility and obligation to care for, pay attention to and maintain students' mental health, so as to create a good campus atmosphere.

N2  - Introduction. Doctors fighting a pandemic is nothing but new on the course of the human history - we have been exposed to multiple plagues since ancient times, sometimes with catastrophic results, and physicians have been in the frontline most of the time. Still, the new age is fighting COVID-19 and managing the trauma it causes on the social and personal level. Our aim was to elicit the very important role the family physician plays in dealing with COVID-19 cases. Material and methods. We reviewed the charts of approximately 200 patients with suspected and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, diagnosed and monitored between September 2020 and May 2021. The symptoms have been charted and their evolution recorded, as well as the treatment received. Most of the patients have been followed by daily phone calls and media devices, and this proves once more the importance of telemedicine nowadays. We retrospectively asked the former patients about their experience in communicating with the family doctor, to be able also to evaluate the degree of psychological support they have received. Results. The symptoms recorded have been consistent with the clinical picture described in the literature (e.g. fever, cough, headache, fatigue). The treatment administered was mostly symptomatic, but we underline the importance of the supplements in improving general condition. Fortunately, only 12 patients required hospitalization, with two fatalities recorded. Over 90% of patients described their interaction with the family medicine doctor or nurse as a positive one, aimed at stress reduction and better coping with their condition. Conclusions. A pandemic of such proportion reaches the top as well the bottom of society - no one is spared of the fear and anxiety it produces. While most of the cases in our study have been mild and moderate, we underline the importance of fast diagnosis, constant communication and proper symptomatic and supportive treatment with major impact on recovery. The Family Physician and the office team plays an important role in monitoring and assisting the SARSCoV- 2 patients, with the aim of reducing hospitalization, the patient anxiety and other negative outcomes.

N2  - Background: The need to address medical students' mental health has grown significantly in recent years. At Tulane University School of Medicine (TUSOM), several groups including the Office of Student Affairs, Phoenix Society, Psychiatry Interest Group, and the Mental Health and Wellness Coalition are dedicated to the mental health and well-being of students. A 2017 study on student-centered approaches to well-being mapped student-identified indicators to their self-care. The study suggested that effective wellness programing should create a culture that supports self-care and addresses maladaptive strategies. Other studies have found that contributors to burnout include the fear of failure, self-doubt, and imposter syndrome. The Night of Resilience was a program created to address the issues of how to survive setbacks and self-doubt while providing a creative outlet for mentors and peers to share stories of resilience. Following a successful inaugural event, the Night of Resilience returned for a second annual event featuring similar stories and music centered around resilience. This year, the focus was on the definition of resilience and whether this event could accurately depict the colloquial understanding of what medical students believe resilience is. Method(s): A slideshow of faculty and students' struggles was gathered through a Google Form survey sent to TUSOM student and faculty listservs. Speakers and performers were invited prior to the event. Food was catered with funds provided by TUSOM Office of Student Affairs and Phoenix Society. A pre-survey was completed at the start of the event that featured a single question: define resilience. A post-survey was emailed to attendees who signed in at the event. Questions ranged from new definitions of resilience to enjoyability of various aspects of the event. Outcome(s): Pre-survey: 32 of 57 (56%) attendees completed the pre-survey. 25 (78%) of the respondents reported a theme of overcoming challenges as the definition of resilience. Example responses included phrases such as the will to get back up, bouncing back, and the ability to face challenges. Post-survey: 15 (26%) attendees completed the post-survey. 12 (80%) of the respondents answered Noto whether their definition of resiliencehas changed. 100% of respondents identified Knowing others have struggled to get to where they areas a theme. The most well-received component of the event was the keynote speaker, Dr. Elma LeDoux (4.9/5 rating). Dr. LeDoux's keynote addressed her personal experiences of resilience, including stories of how she became involved in medicine, her struggle to cope with death and hardship, and her ability to overcome such challenges. Her examples were not dissimilar to many medical students who aspire to become strong-willed physicians, and allowed students to connect well with her story. Using the feedback provided from this event, the TUSOM Mental Health and Wellness Coalition will be working with future Tulane groups to improve future well-being related events. Learning Objectives Provide mental health programming to their medical students at respective institutions. Use pre- and post-surveys to determine if students learned the lessons the event planners were hoping for.

N2  - Introduction: Mindfulness is a mental state attained through focusing awareness on the present with calm acceptance of thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. This study evaluated impact of mindfulness activities on well-being of pharmacy and other healthcare students. Method(s): Research participants completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires evaluating multi-modal mindfulness interventions. Due to the pandemic, sessions led by a certified mindfulness instructor were offered live online and recorded, supplemented by a well-being mobile app and reflective discussion component. Four composite scales were administered to participants. The Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS), Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-15), Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) inventories measured resilient coping skills, awareness, and psychological symptoms, including stress, depression, and anxiety. Exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha were used to determine scale reliability and validity. Result(s): Thirty-six participants completed both pre- and post-intervention questionnaires (n = 36). Significant improvement was found in well-being for BRCS, FFMQ-15, and WEMWBS measures (P <.05). Change in DASS-21 was not significant (P =.19). Mobile app use enhanced foundational mindfulness skills. Awareness, connection, and coping themes were identified from written comments. Conclusion(s): Evaluation of this multi-modal interprofessional intervention provides further evidence of benefits of mindfulness for pharmacy and other healthcare students. The mobile app and mindful movement with reflection improved all attributes measured by the composite scales. Further research may explore alternative multi-modal mindfulness interventions and incorporation into healthcare education curricula. Interprofessional collaboration is encouraged among faculty to enhance mindfulness while connecting healthcare professionals.Copyright Â© 2024 Elsevier Inc.

METHOD(S): Rehabilitation professionals (physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and registered nurses; n =436) from 4 health care organizations in the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest regions in the USA completed a battery of questionnaires related to personal attributes (resilience and orientation toward lifelong learning), environmental attributes (innovation support and basic psychological need satisfaction at work), loci of engagement (professional and organizational), career satisfaction, and intention to stay. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. RESULT(S): The measurement and structural model fit was acceptable. The greatest total effects on career satisfaction (r =.459) and intention to stay (r =.462) were observed through the influences of basic psychological need satisfaction, professional engagement, and organizational engagement. Orientation toward lifelong learning was negatively associated with career satisfaction (r =-.208) and intention to stay (r =-.154), but this was mitigated by organizational engagement (r =-.060 and-.134, respectively). Small but significant total effects were also observed between innovation support, professional and organizational engagement, and intention to stay (r =.144) and resilience, professional and organizational engagement, and career satisfaction (r =.110). CONCLUSION(S): Clinical learning environments that support rehabilitation professionals' basic psychological needs (autonomy, competency, and relatedness) are associated with greater career satisfaction and intention to stay. This association is further enhanced by organizational engagement and innovation support. IMPACT: Rehabilitation organizations interested in developing and retaining master adaptive learners should create clinical learning environments that reinforce rehabilitation professionals' sense of autonomy, competency, and relatedness, and are supportive on innovative behaviors.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Burnout syndrome is a global burden characterized by exhaustion, work detachment, and a sense of ineffectiveness. It affects millions of individuals worldwide, with a particularly high prevalence among medical students. Factors such as demanding education, exposure to suffering, and the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to elevated stress levels. Addressing this issue is crucial due to its impact on well-being and health-care quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey study assessed fear of COVID-19 and burnout levels among medical student interns in hospitals in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The study used validated scales and collected data from September 2021 to September 2022. A snowball sampling method was employed and a minimum sample size of 198 participants was calculated. RESULT(S): This study included 311 medical students (62.1% female and 37.9% male with a mean age of 23.51+/-2.21years). The majority were in their second semester of internship (60.5%) and from public hospitals (89.1%). Most students believed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the quality of their internship (82.6%). Female students had higher personal burnout scores, while male students had higher work-related burnout scores. The mean score for fear of COVID-19 was 13.71+/-6.28, with higher scores among women (p=0.004) and those from public hospitals (p=0.009). A positive weak correlation was found between COVID-19 scores and burnout subscales. CONCLUSION(S): Our study emphasizes the significant impact of various factors on burnout levels among medical students and health-care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prolonged exposure to COVID-19 patients, reduced staffing, and increased workload contributed to burnout, affecting well-being and quality of care. Targeted interventions and resilience-building strategies are needed to mitigate burnout and promote well-being in health-care settings.

N2  - AIMS: To investigate the relationship between the psychological resilience and burnout of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients and to determine the factors that affect their psychological resilience and burnout. BACKGROUND: In pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, nurses experience burnout due to long working hours, decreased quality of life and anxiety/fear about their own/families' health. Psychological resilience helps to control burnout in nurses and prevent the development of a global nurse shortage. DESIGN: This was a descriptive, correlational study. METHOD(S): The sample of this study included 201 nurses in a Training and Research Hospital. The study used the Brief Resilience Scale and the Burnout Measure Short Version. Data were collected between 4 May and 1 June 2020. Statistical analysis was made with Pearson/Spearman, independent sample t test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. RESULT(S): Nurses reported moderate burnout and psychological resilience, with a negative and highly significant correlation between psychological resilience and burnout levels. CONCLUSION(S): In order to increase the quality of patient care/treatment, nurse managers need to reduce nurses' burnout and increase their psychological resilience. Nurses are recommended to adopt a healthy lifestyle, organize training programmes and implement psychological resilience interventions to prevent sleep disorders. Giving nurses the tools to understand what they need to manage within their locus of control will allow them to find a new sense of resilience, preventing potential burnout.Copyright Â© 2024 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Current literature emphasises the importance of resilience in health care. Studies have shown that lack of resilience not only leads to adverse clinical outcomes but is also associated with burnout and long-term stress in clinicians. Resource-limited rural settings in the United States often impose unique stressors, and thus, it is critical to examine resilience of health care providers practicing rural medicine. METHOD(S): An anonymous REDCap survey was completed by medical students, residents and attending physicians between 7 April 2021 and 18 May 2022. The primary outcome of resilience was measured by the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10 (CD-RISC-10Â© ). RESULT(S): Survey takers scored moderately on the resilience scale (30.64 on a 40-point scale). The first quartile of respondents scored between 0 and 28; the second quartile scored between 29 and 30; the third quartile scored between 31 and 35; the fourth quartile scored between 36 and 40. Age and years of service were not correlated with resilience. However, survey takers who had been exposed to trauma informed care scored significantly higher on the resilience scale (32.37 vs. 28.85, p=0.021). The level of resilience when compared by profession was found to be comparable among medical students, residents and attending physicians. CONCLUSION(S): Individuals scoring in the first two quartiles of the CD-RISC-10Â© perhaps indicate need for support as they are having difficulty coping with stress. Health care organisations should provide resilience training to support the wellness and mental health of their staff. Moreover, dedicated efforts should be made toward creating trauma-informed health care organisations as exposure to the topic of trauma informed care had a significant positive impact on resilience.Copyright Â© 2024 Association for the Study of Medical Education and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Physician-brief advice has been utilized in high-income countries to promote smoking cessation among cancer patients. Empirical evidence on its effectiveness among cancer patients in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) is lacking. The gap could be due to inadequate training, and competing healthcare priorities, leading to insufficient implementation of targeted smoking cessation interventions in oncology settings. We undertook this scoping review to determine if physician-brief advice is effective in promoting smoking cessation among cancer patients in LMICs. Method(s): We conducted a literature search of all relevant articles across five databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Library (Tobacco Addiction Group trials), World Conference on Lung Cancer proceedings, PubMed, and Google Scholar up to November 2023, using pre-defined inclusion criteria and keywords. The study population was cancer survivors in LMICs, the intervention was smoking cessation advice by a physician in a clinic or oncology center during a consultation, and the outcome was the effect of smoking cessation programs in discontinuing smoking among cancer survivors in LMICs. Result(s): Overall, out of every 10 cancer patients in LMICs, about seven were smokers, and one-half had received physician-brief advice for smoking cessation. Physician-brief advice was more likely to be delivered to patients with smoking-related cancer (Cohen's d = 0.396). This means that there is a noticeable difference between patients with smoking-related cancer compared to those with cancer unrelated to smoking. Smoking cessation failure was due to the inability to cope with the symptoms of withdrawal, missed smoking cessation clinic visits, mental health disorders, limited time and resources, and minimal patient-physician contact. Conclusion(s): There is very little literature on the frequency of use or the efficacy of physician-brief advice on smoking cessation in LMICs. The literature suggests that cancer patients in LMICs have low self-efficacy to quit smoking, and smoking cessation is rarely part of cancer care in LMICs. Physicians in LMICs should be trained to use motivational messages and good counseling techniques to improve smoking cessation among cancer patients. Policymakers should allocate the resources to implement physician-brief advice and design training programs for physicians focusing on physician-brief advice tailored to cancer patients.Copyright Â© 2024, The Author(s).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The study sought to provide an overview of the perspectives and experiences of Jordanian nurses in the context of caring for patients undergoing palliative chemotherapy. METHOD(S): A phenomenological qualitative design was used to explore the perspectives and experiences of 11 Jordanian nurses providing care to patients receiving palliative chemotherapy at a governmental cancer care center. RESULT(S): The nurses identified two main themes: "Patient Persistence in Hope" and "Positive Impacts of Palliative Chemotherapy." They observed that some patients held onto false hopes of a cure when consenting to palliative chemotherapy, often influenced by family pressure. However, despite acknowledging fatigue as a major side effect, the nurses generally had a positive view of palliative chemotherapy, especially when it improved patients' quality of life or relieved pain. The nurses believed that the patients' resilience and positive attitude during treatment were encouraging. CONCLUSION(S): To better support patients, the study suggests that nurses should gain a deeper understanding of the significance patients attach to hope in advanced cancer situations to avoid misinterpreting it as denial or false optimism.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The effectiveness of the Stress Management and Resilience Training (SMART) with U.S. military personnel has not been reported in the literature. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of SMART in increasing resilience in Air Force healthcare personnel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a pilot, randomized preventive trial with active component Air Force healthcare personnel. SMART was offered via an in-person, 2-h training session delivered through face-to-face or synchronous video teleconference training, or via a self-paced, computer-based training. A baseline survey included demographics questions and the Connor-Davidson-10 Resilience Scale (CD-10), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and overall quality of life (QOL) measure. Follow-up surveys with the CD-10, PSS, GAD-7, and quality of life were sent to participants at 12, 18, and 24weeks after completing SMART. RESULT(S): Fifty-six service members completed the baseline assessment and were randomized to either the in-person modality (comprised of video teleconference or face-to-face training) or the computer-based training modality, and 49 participants completed SMART. Significant increases in median CD-10 scores were observed among all participants, showing a 4-point (14%), 6-point (21%), and 5-point (17%) increase at week-12, -18, and -24, respectively, from the baseline. A significant overall decrease in median PSS scores from baseline were observed, with 5.5-points (22%), 7.81-points (32%), and 8.5-points (35%) decrease at 12, 18, and 24weeks post-SMART, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): In this pilot study, SMART demonstrated significant and meaningful improvements in self-reported CD-10 and PSS-14 scores at 12, 18, and 24weeks post-training completion. A future replication of the study is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of SMART on a larger scale.Copyright Â© The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2023.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aims to estimate the global prevalence of bullying among nursing students during clinical practice and identify associated factors. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. REVIEW METHODS AND DATA SOURCES: We conducted a comprehensive literature search across ten databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Chinese Biomedical, China National Knowledge Internet, and WANFANG) from their inception to January 3, 2023. Two researchers independently screened potentially eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality. Data were analyzed using random-effects or fixed-effects models. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression explored the influence of participant and study characteristics on bullying prevalence. Publication bias and sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULT(S): We included 28 studies (N = 9511) from 13 countries on five continents. The pooled estimate of bullying prevalence among nursing students during clinical practice was 65.60 % (95 % CI 55. 75 to 74.27), with no evidence of publication bias (t = 1.51, p-value = 0.14). Subgroup and moderator analyses highlighted the impact of country, continent, publication year, and assessment tool on bullying prevalence. CONCLUSION(S): Nursing students face a high prevalence of bullying during clinical practice. Addressing this issue in nursing education requires prioritizing associated factors, fostering a culture of safety, providing effective training, and promoting individual resilience. These actions can prevent and mitigate bullying, creating a supportive and empowering learning environment for future nurses.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that others do not) are a common feature of psychosis, causing significant distress and disability. Existing treatments such as cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) have modest benefits, and there is a lack of CBTp-trained staff. Shorter, targeted treatments that focus on specific symptoms delivered by a non-specialist workforce could substantially increase access to treatment.Managing Unusual Sensory Experiences (MUSE) explains why people have hallucinations and helps the person to develop and use coping strategies to reduce distress. MUSE focuses only on hallucinations, and treatment is short (four to six, 1-hour sessions per week). It is a digital intervention, run on National Health Service (NHS) laptops, which provides information about hallucinations in an engaging way, using audio, video and animated content. Crucially, it is designed for use by non-specialist staff like community psychiatric nurses. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a two-arm feasibility randomised controlled trial comparing MUSE and treatment as usual (TAU) (n=40) to TAU alone (n=40), recruiting across two NHS Trusts, using 1:1 allocation and blind assessments before and after treatment (2 months) and at follow-up (3 months). Quantitative information on recruitment rates, adherence and completion of outcome assessments will be collected. Qualitative interviews will capture service users' experience of therapy and clinicians' experiences of the training and supervision in MUSE. Clinicians will also be asked about factors affecting uptake, adherence and facilitators/barriers to implementation. Analyses will focus on feasibility outcomes and provide initial estimates of intervention effects. Thematic analysis of the qualitative interviews will assess the acceptability of the training, intervention and trial procedures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has received NHS Ethical and Health Research Authority approval. Findings will be disseminated directly to participants and services, as well as through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

T1  - Individual and organisational strategies to develop resilience in the nursing workforce
A1  - Cajanding R.J. 
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Nurses are likely to encounter a wide range of distressing, challenging and sometimes traumatic situations. However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created unprecedented levels of stress, risk, uncertainty and anxiety for nurses. Nurses have been working in highly challenging conditions, particularly on the front line of patient care, which has had adverse effects on their mental health and well-being. The challenges generated by the COVID-19 pandemic have called into question the notion of nursing being an innately resilient profession. Consequently, the pandemic has reinforced the need for individuals, teams and healthcare organisations to foster resilience in nurses. This article discusses the theoretical underpinnings of resilience, explains what resilience in nurses means, and describes the adverse effects of the pandemic on nurses' mental health and resilience. The article also explores how nurses' resilience can be developed and enhanced from an individual and organisational perspective.Copyright Â© 2021 RCN Publishing Company Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The contribution of work to positive mental health is increasingly apparent. Transition into the workplace causes a range of stressors for new graduate nurses who experience both psychological wellbeing and illbeing in their first year of practice. OBJECTIVE(S): To determine published prevalence, predictors, barriers and enablers of new graduate registered nurse wellbeing, work wellbeing and mental health. DESIGN: Systematic review of quantitative research. DATA SOURCES: Databases included Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica database, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online and Psychological Information. Quantitative and mixed-methods studies were considered for inclusion if published in English from 2009 to 2019 reporting primary data analysis including new graduate nurses' wellbeing, work wellbeing and mental health. REVIEW METHODS: Quantitative studies were systematically identified then screened and appraised against pre-determined inclusion criteria. Analysis was conducted by grouping according to analytical methods and results reported as a narrative synthesis. RESULT(S): Thirty-four studies were included. The quality of the evidence was variable with just a quarter of the studies being assessed as meeting the quality criteria on all nine measures. For the new graduate nurses prevalence of wellbeing, levels of resilience, optimism, and hope were found to be high. For work wellbeing, most reported higher job satisfaction by 12-months. For work illbeing, levels of burnout were moderately high, predominantly in terms of emotional exhaustion, and stress was initially high, particularly in terms of workload, but decreased over time. For the predictors, job satisfaction was positively predicted by structural empowerment and career satisfaction, and negatively predicted by co-worker incivility, supervisor incivility and emotional exhaustion. For work illbeing, stress was a positive predictor for intent to leave. Stress reductions were associated with momentary levels of high task mastery, social acceptance and role clarity. CONCLUSION(S): For new graduate nurses, levels of emotional exhaustion, workload and stress were moderately high to high initially, decreasing over time as the graduate nurses' job satisfaction increased. Most studies focused on the nurses' intent to resign or stay and both psychological capital and work engagement positively predicted intent to stay whereas work stress positively predicted intent to resign. Resilience and group cohesion moderated the negative effects of some variables, thus may be potential enablers of work wellbeing. The standards of research reporting or design were generally sub-optimal according to quality indicators. Systematic review registration number: (CRD42020148812).Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Burnout is prevalent in health care. As professionals advocate to increase resilience training as a strategy to reduce burnout, few examples exist of practical resilience programs that equip faculty to help students build and sustain well-being over time. Method(s): We developed two straightforward, skills-based resilience exercises. Breaking Down Easy taught individuals to identify personal strengths. My Resilience Practice helped individuals identify strategies to cope with daily stressors. We taught these exercises to international faculty in a train-the-trainer workshop format, at two medical education conferences. Faculty applied the exercises, performed pair-share reflections, and discussed opportunities to introduce the exercises in their own institutions. Postsession surveys evaluated the workshop quality and the exercises' ease of use and applicability. Result(s): Thirty-five faculty and five students participated across two international conferences. Of participants, 83% (33 of 40) completed postsession surveys. On a 5-point Likert scale, participants rated the workshop on average 4.4 for usefulness, 4.6 for applicability, 4.4 for ease of instruction, 4.5 for clarity, and 4.8 for overall quality. Participants found the exercises to be straightforward to use and planned to use them at their institutions with students, residents, and faculty. Discussion(s): Participants found our workshop to be relevant and effective and shared their intention to incorporate these materials into their teaching with medical students, residents, and faculty. Implementing effective programs to build resilience is critical to increasing well-being and reducing burnout. This, in turn, may enhance patient safety and improve health system outcomes.Copyright Â© 2021 Gheihman et al.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Forgiveness is a concept of growing interest within psychology and of potential relevance to public health. While there has been increasing evidence suggesting positive associations between forgiveness of others and a range of psychosocial well-being and mental health outcomes, its associations with health behaviors and physical health are less clear. METHOD(S): This study used longitudinal data from the Nurses' Health Study II (2008 Trauma Exposure and Post-traumatic Stress Supplementary Survey to 2015 questionnaire wave, N=54,703), to conduct an outcome-wide analysis among a cohort of female nurses in the United States (age range: 43-64years). The study prospectively examines the association between spiritually motivated forgiveness of others and a number of of subsequent psychosocial well-being, mental health, health behavior, and physical health outcomes in midlife. A set of linear, logistic, and Poisson regression models were used to regress each outcome on forgiveness in separate models. Sociodemographic factors, prior religious service attendance, and prior values of all outcome variables were controlled for wherever data were available. To account for multiple testing, we performed Bonferroni correction. RESULT(S): Forgiveness was associated with subsequent improved psychosocial well-being and reduced psychological distress outcomes in a monotonic pattern. For instance, the top versus bottom level of forgiveness was associated with substantially higher levels of subsequent positive affect (beta=0.18, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.21) and social integration (beta=0.15, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.17), and was inversely associated with several indicators of subsequent psychological distress such as depressive symptoms (beta=-0.16, 95% CI: -0.19, -0.14). However, in this sample, there was little evidence that forgiveness was associated with health behaviors or physical health outcomes. DISCUSSION: This study suggests that forgiveness may be a health asset for promoting population mental health and psychosocial well-being, and moreover may also be understood as a good in itself. Further investigation on the dynamics between forgiveness and physical health is warranted to explore the discrepancy between the results here and some past research.

N2  - Background: In 2018, >75,000 children were newly affected by the diagnosis of advanced cancer in a parent. Unfortunately, few programs exist to help parents and their children manage the impact of advanced disease together as a family. The Enhancing Connections-Palliative Care (EC-PC) parenting program was developed in response to this gap. Objective(s): (1) Assess the feasibility of the EC-PC parenting program (recruitment, enrollment, and retention); (2) test the short-term impact of the program on changes in parent and child outcomes; and (3) explore the relationship between parents' physical and psychological symptoms with program outcomes. Design(s): Quasi-experimental two-group design employing both within- and between-subjects analyses to examine change over time and change relative to historical controls. Parents participated in five telephone-delivered and fully manualized behavioral intervention sessions at two-week intervals, delivered by trained nurses. Behavioral assessments were obtained at baseline and at three months on parents' depressed mood, anxiety, parenting skills, parenting self-efficacy, and symptom distress as well as children's behavioral-emotional adjustment (internalizing, externalizing, and anxiety/depression). Subjects: Parents diagnosed with advanced or metastatic cancer and receiving noncurative treatment were eligible for the trial provided they had one or more children aged 5-17 living at home, were able to read, write, and speak English, and were not enrolled in a hospice program. Result(s): Of those enrolled, 62% completed all intervention sessions and post-intervention assessments. Within-group analyses showed significant improvements in parents' self-efficacy in helping their children manage pressures from the parent's cancer; parents' skills to elicit children's cancer-related concerns; and parents' skills to help their children cope with the cancer. Between-group analyses revealed comparable improvements with historical controls on parents' anxiety, depressed mood, self-efficacy, parenting skills, and children's behavioral-emotional adjustment. Conclusion(s): The EC-PC parenting program shows promise in significantly improving parents' skills and confidence in supporting their child about the cancer. Further testing of the program is warranted.

N2  - Primary health care is considered to be a practical approach to provide basic curative, preventive and promotive health care as an accessible medium for the people particularly in low resource income countries in an affordable way. This paper reviewed that an integrated primary health care system could reduce fundamental vulnerability of disasters; thereafter protect the health facilities and services for providing health programs. Further it focused on the increased uptake on health services to build resilience among individuals of low resource countries having high exposure to disasters. It also provides an idea on the practices adapted for gaining resilience of primary health care of low resource regions like Africa, South and South East Asia which are frequently exposed to disasters. However, this study did not focus on the health governance, pre-hospital disaster management and funding policies which are limited at present in low income countries affected by frequent disasters. Keywords: Disasters; disaster management; low income countries; primary health care; resilience.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Introduction: The article deals with the peculiarities of physicians' stress in conditions of exam stress in postgraduate education as a structural-functional, dynamic, integrative property of the person, as a result of transactional process of collision of an individual with with the individual stress factors, which includes cognitive representation, the objective characterization of the situation and requirements for the individual. The course of diagnosis and adaptive capacity is considered in terms of physical, emotional and mental capacity, ability for social adaptation, to ensure the successful fulfillment, achievement of life goals, maintain homeostasis, efficiency and health. The aim of the research is to determine the impact of the development of teaching and exam stress on the process of adaptation of doctors in postgraduate education during continuous professional development; to study measures that will prevent the development of stress. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Material(s) and Method(s): In the work is used a range of methods: content analysis, bibliosemantic, systematic approach, analysis of products of activity. RESULT(S): Review: In the human body there is a mechanism that promotes adaptation to various traumatic environmental factors that can lead to changes in the functioning of the organism. This response to the body is called a general adaptive syndrome or stress response, the main issues of which were worked out by the founder of the theory of stress Hans Sielie. Significant increase in the harmful effects of various factors on the body disturbs its livelihoods and causes the stress of all adaptation systems and in the future can lead to significant damage to the body. At present, scientists are considering several types of stress: biological, psychological, professional, emotional, sports, educational, exam and others. Academic and exam stress is one of the leading places among the causes that cause psychological stress in doctors in postgraduate education. Not successful in building exam can become a psycho-traumatic factors and create a trigger mechanism for reactive depression. Training stress refers to chronic stress while examinations can be attributed to acute stress. CONCLUSION(S): Conclusion(s): Therefore, it should be noted that frequent and prolonged stresses are gradually accumulating and may cause health problems. Any stressful situation causes changes in hemodynamics. In general, according to scientists, those people who are able to cope with stress have fewer health problems than those who are too stressed out of stress. Therefore, to manage stress, you need to learn how to control yourself and your emotions and more confidently approach non-standard situations.

N2  - Background: Psychological distress is common in maintenance hemodialysis patients, and high psychological resilience can promote psychological well-being. The current research focuses on psychological resilience protective factors such as family resilience and social support. However, the trajectories of psychological resilience, family resilience, and social support over time and their longitudinal relationships in maintenance hemodialysis patients have not been fully explored yet. Therefore, this study aims to explore the longitudinal relationship between these factors. Method(s): Patients who received regular hemodialysis treatment for more than three months at dialysis centers of three tertiary hospitals in Zhejiang, China, were recruited from September to December 2020. A total of 252 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria completed three follow-up surveys, including social support, family resilience, and psychological resilience assessments. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to explore differences in their respective scores at different time points. The cross-lagged analysis was performed in AMOS using the maximum likelihood method to examine the the reciprocal predictive relationships between these factors. Result(s): Social support and psychological resilience remained relatively stable over time, whereas family resilience indicated a little increasing trend. According to the cross-lagged analysis, higher T1 social support predicted higher family resilience at T2 [beta = 0.123, 95% CI (0.026-0.244)]. Further, the effects of T2 social support to T3 family resilience [beta = 0.194, 95%CI (0.039-0.335)] and psychological resilience [beta = 0.205, 95%CI (0.049-0.354)] were significant. Finally, the effects of T2 family resilience to T3 social support [beta = 0.122, 95%CI (0.010-0.225)] and psychological resilience [beta = 0.244, 95%CI (0.119-0.359)] were also significant. Conclusion(s): The study showed that the directionality of the relationship appears to be from social support or family resilience to patients' psychological resilience but not vice versa. This finding reminds healthcare professionals to emphasize the vital role of social and family resources in providing appropriate support and interventions for maintenance hemodialysis patients to promote psychological resilience and mental health development.Copyright Â© 2024, The Author(s).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Globally, adults 50 years and older are an increasing proportion of persons living with HIV (PLHIV), accounting for 16% of the patient group globally. The long-term effects of antiretroviral use are still being discovered and have been associated with several comorbidities; Stigma presents challenges for those in need of services and health care and can significantly affect mental health and treatment adherence. Understanding the experiences and challenges of older PLHIV will inform the development of interventions to improve their care, health, and quality of life, which may help prevent the further spread of HIV. We explored the experiences and challenges of older PLHIV aged 50 years and above. METHOD(S): We conducted 40 in-depth interviews with elderly PLHIV aged 50 years and above who had lived with HIV for more than ten years. We also explored the experiences and challenges of ageing with HIV in two hospitals. We analysed the data thematically. RESULT(S): The key themes that emerged included; late diagnosis of HIV, depression and fear at the time of diagnosis, acceptance of close family, stigma from community, polypharmacy, development of comorbidities, financial burden, resilience, and mastery of own care. CONCLUSION(S): Older adults experience several challenges, and there is a need to develop special clinics providing appropriate care for the ageing and their social life. Prevention, Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of HIV, and appropriate geriatric care are essential for the well-being of elderly PLHIV.Copyright Â© 2024. The Author(s).

N2  - AIMS: To examine the level of resilience and burnout among British nurses during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the influence of personal, social and organisational factors on nurses' resilience and burnout. BACKGROUND: Nurses experienced excessive workload and emotional demands over a prolonged period during the COVID-19 pandemic which may have led to exhaustion. Little research has examined the correlation between the pandemic variables, nurses' resilience and burnout during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: This study utilised a descriptive, cross-sectional research design. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional and self-report survey involved 111 staff nurses, who completed a self-administrated questionnaire between January and April 2021. A STORBE checklist was used to report the study results. FINDINGS: The study found that nurses experienced a high level of burnout and low to moderate levels of resilience. The study revealed significant negative relationships between the level of burnout and perceived organisational support and nurses' resilience. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses' social roles and their worries about patient safety were positively correlated with burnout. The perceived organisational support, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses' social roles and the level of resilience were significant factors for burnout. CONCLUSION(S): Nurses experienced a high level of burnout during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be influenced by how they felt their organisations supported them. Nurses' feelings that the pandemic affected their social roles were associated with increasing their burnout. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Strategies should be developed to address staff burnout and resilience. Nurse managers and educators should play leadership roles in creating professional training to include competencies and psychological preparedness for disasters and to implement strategies to increase the organisational commitments to staff safety and well-being.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Communication opportunities about sexuality are of great importance as an integral component of quality of life for patients with gynecologic cancers. Information about expected (possibly temporary) therapy-related restrictions is basal. In order to meet the justified demand for quality in the conduct of discussions, an empathetic attitude is required that anticipates possible fears, feelings of shame and guilt on the part of the patients and their partners. Interventions that take resources into account and pick up on points of view from the sexual history that can stimulate constructive developments are resilience-strengthening. A physician's attitude that takes into account the variety of ways to experience sexuality even after gynecologic cancer is encouraging and often also has a constructive and de-frightening effect on couple relationships and lowers the risk for psychological comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. The doctor-patient relationship is thus strengthened and can gain a new dimension of trust.Copyright Â© 2024 Mediengruppe Oberfranken - Fachverlage GmbH & Co. KG. All rights reserved.

T1  - Theory and Practice of Empowerment for Family Members of Patients Under Custodial Protection Sentence
A1  - Kuo Y.-H. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Empowerment not only benefits patients but also provides support and assistance to their family members, especially in cases when patients are subject to custodial protection sentences. The positive effects of empowerment on patients' family members may be summarized into three main aspects, including: enhancing their engagement in healthcare, alleviating their anxiety, and enhancing their caregiving skills. With regard to enhancing engagement in healthcare, family members receive health education that provides an overview of the illness, treatment options, prognosis, and key nursing points and allows them to better understand the patient's condition and actively participate in decision-making. With regard to alleviating anxiety, patients under custodial protection sentences are involved in legal problems, which results in higher levels of stress for family members compared to their peers caring for general patients. Through emotional support and active listening, nurses provide opportunities for family members to express their concerns and offer comfort and encouragement, helping them cope with difficulties and pressures. With regard to enhancing caregiving skills, the purpose of custodial protection sentences is to prevent recidivism, and family members bear significant responsibility for caregiving after discharge. Nurses can share similar caregiving experiences from their ward, educate family members about observing symptoms, and provide guidance, thereby strengthening their caregiving capabilities. In addition, with regard to the disposition of patients, nurses assist family members to understand the medical process and provide necessary guidance, ensuring family members have a clear understanding and are respected during the preparations for discharge. Based on related theoretical frameworks and practical experiences, this research highlights the positive role of empowerment in enhancing the caregiving abilities and satisfaction of the family members of patients, particularly those subject to custodial protection sentences.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patient safety culture is an indicator of healthcare quality and a topic of global importance in medical care. PURPOSE: In this study, the attitudes towards patient safety culture of nursing staff working in the emergency, intensive care, and general wards are compared before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): A retrospective research design was utilized and an anonymous questionnaire survey conducted on the Taiwan Patient Safety Culture Survey web-based platform system was used to collect the data. The survey was administered in a regional hospital in northern Taiwan between 2018 and 2020. The 1,540 nursing personnel who participated in this study worked in the emergency, intensive care units, or general adult ward. The analysis focused on assessing participant attitudes towards patient safety culture in terms of both the overall score and sub-dimensions. RESULT(S): The participants were mostly female and between 21 and 30 years old. A majority had completed a diploma or university education. The two analyses revealed the highest and lowest average scores were earned, respectively, in the "teamwork" and "resilience" dimensions of patient safety culture. In 2020, the average scores for all dimensions were lower than in 2018, and the average scores for the emergency and critical care group were lower than those for the general adult ward group. Sub-dimension analysis showed that the general adult ward group earned significantly higher scores in "teamwork" across all three sub-dimensions compared to the emergency and critical care groups. The general ward group exhibited the most significant score decline between the two surveys. CONCLUSIONS / IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Overall scores were found to have decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020). Notably, emergency and intensive care nurses earned consistently lower scores, likely due to the severity of patient conditions and increased pandemic-related workloads and stress. "Resilience" scores were the lowest among all nursing staff, with the most significant drop seen in general ward nurses. Enhancing nursing staff education and training as well as addressing their psychological well-being will be crucial to improving patient safety culture attitudes. Managers should provide infection control, resilience training, and psychological counseling to help nurses manage the challenges posed by infectious diseases effectively and enhance patient safety culture.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Past literature establishes high prevalence of burn-out among intensive care unit (ICU) nurses, and the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic in intensifying burn-out. However, the specific pandemic-related contributors and practical approaches to address burn-out have not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, this work focuses on investigating the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the burn-out experiences of ICU nurses and identifying practical approaches for burn-out mitigation. DESIGN: Semistructured focus group interviews were conducted via convenience sampling and qualitatively analysed to identify burn-out contributors and mitigators. Maslach Burnout Inventory for Medical Personnel (MBI-MP) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5) were employed to quantify the prevalence of burn-out of the participants at the time of study. SETTING: Two ICUs designated as COVID-19 ICUs in a large metropolitan tertiary care hospital in the Greater Houston area (Texas, USA). PARTICIPANTS: Twenty registered ICU nurses (10 from each unit). RESULT(S): Participants experienced high emotional exhaustion (MBI-MP mean score 32.35, SD 10.66), moderate depersonalisation (M 9.75, SD 7.10) and moderate personal achievement (M 32.05, SD 7.59) during the pandemic. Ten out of the 20 participants exhibited post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (PCL-5 score >33). Regarding contributors to burn-out in nurses during the pandemic, five thematic levels emerged-personal, patient related, coworker related, organisational and societal-with each factor comprising several subthemes (eg, emotional detachment from patients, constant need to justify motives to patients' family, lack of staffing and resources, and politicisation of COVID-19 and vaccination). Participants revealed several practical interventions to help overcome burn-out, ranging from mental health coverage to educating public on the severity of the pandemic and importance of vaccination. CONCLUSION(S): By identifying the contributors to burn-out in ICU nurses at a systems level, the study findings inform the design and implementation of effective interventions to prevent or mitigate pandemic-related burn-out among nurses.Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: US military veterans have disproportionately high rates of diabetes and diabetes-related morbidity in addition to being at risk of comorbid stress-related conditions. This study aimed to examine the effects of a technology-supported mindfulness intervention integrated into usual diabetes care and education on psychological and biobehavioral outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Veterans (N=132) with type 1 or 2 diabetes participated in this two-arm randomized controlled efficacy trial. The intervention arm received a one-session mindfulness intervention integrated into a pre-existing program of diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) plus one booster session and 24 weeks of home practice supported by a mobile application. The control arm received one 3-hour comprehensive DSMES group session. The primary outcome was change in diabetes distress (DD). The secondary outcomes were diabetes self-care behaviors, diabetes self-efficacy, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, mindfulness, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), body weight, and blood pressure. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. Participant satisfaction and engagement in home practice were assessed in the intervention group at 12 and 24 weeks. RESULT(S): Intention-to-treat group by time analyses showed a statistically significant improvement in DD in both arms without significant intervention effect from baseline to 24 weeks. Examination of distal effects on DD between weeks 12 and 24 showed significantly greater improvement in the intervention arm. Improvement in DD was greater when baseline HbA1C was <8.5%. A significant intervention effect was also shown for general dietary behaviors. The secondary outcomes diabetes self-efficacy, PTSD, depression, and HbA1C significantly improved in both arms without significant intervention effects. Mindfulness and body weight were unchanged in either group. CONCLUSION(S): A technology-supported mindfulness intervention integrated with DSMES showed stronger distal effects on DD compared with DSMES control. Examination of longer-term outcomes, underlying mechanisms, and the feasibility of virtual delivery is warranted.

N2  - Introduction: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires residency programs to support residents' well-being via established policies and programs. Imposter syndrome has been linked to burnout in residents, and understanding how to combat it may help improve resiliency in residents. Method(s): We held a facilitator-guided, interactive discussion session for internal medicine residents on the topic of imposter syndrome as part of a larger series of discussion sessions on resident wellness. We repeated the session to capture a different group of residents. A psychologist or chief resident led each 30- to 45-minute session with the option to include an attending physician. Residents, faculty, and a clinical psychologist developed instructions for leading this session. At the end of each session, the facilitator provided attendees with a handout with take-home points and an optional postsurvey to assess learning objectives and ask whether they felt this was an effective intervention to promote resident wellness. Result(s): We collected data from 21 residents who attended the small-group discussion sessions. Ninety-six percent of residents felt comfortable recognizing imposter syndrome in themselves, and 62% knew the appropriate next steps after identifying imposter syndrome. Eighty-one percent of residents felt that the imposter syndrome wellness session was an effective intervention to promote resident wellness. Discussion(s): Imposter syndrome has been linked to resident burnout, and discussing imposter syndrome was viewed as an effective intervention to promote resident wellness and resiliency. When creating wellness interventions, other programs should consider addressing imposter syndrome.Copyright Â© 2020 Baumann et al.

N2  - AIMS: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of Mindfulness-based Wellness and Resilience (MBWR): a brief mindfulness-based intervention designed to enhance resilience and is delivered to interdisciplinary primary care teams. BACKGROUND: Burnout is a pervasive, international problem affecting the healthcare workforce, characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and decreased professional effectiveness. Delivery models of mindfulness-based resilience interventions that enhance feasibility for onsite delivery, consider cultural considerations specific to primary care, and utilize team processes that are integral to primary care are now needed. METHOD(S): We conducted a mixed-methods feasibility and acceptability trial of MBWR. Primary feasibility and acceptability outcomes were assessed by number of participants recruited, percent of MBWR treatment completer, and attrition rate during the 8-week intervention, and four items on a Likert-type scale. Secondary outcomes of perceived effects were measured by focus groups, an online survey, and self-reported questionnaires, including the Brief Resilience Scale, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form, and the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form. Participants included 31 healthcare providers on interdisciplinary primary care teams employed a safety-net medical center. In the MBWR group, 68% identified as Latinx, compared to 64% in the control group. FINDINGS: All criteria for feasibility were met and participants endorsed high levels of satisfaction and acceptability. The results of this study suggest that MBWR provides multiple perceived benefits to the individual healthcare provider, cohesion of the healthcare team, and enhanced patient care. MBWR may be a feasible and acceptable method to integrate mindfulness, resilience, and teamwork training into the primary care setting.

T1  - Curbing Burnout Hysteria With Self-Compassion: A Key to Physician Resilience
A1  - Sotile W.M.
A1  - Fallon R.
A1  - Orlando J. 
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Never before has physician suffering received as much attention in the peer-reviewed medical literature and popular media as now. The purpose of this paper is to propose that the manner in which these concerns are being addressed is further complicating physician and medical family well-being due to the perpetuation of work ambivalence. METHOD(S): A search of the English literature was conducted using PubMed to identify papers addressing physician burnout and other forms of psychosocial suffering. In addition, a review of case records from the past 40 years of clinical experiences as counselors and life coaches to physicians and their life mates was conducted. RESULT(S): Reported levels of physician burnout and psychosocial morbidity have escalated over the past 10 years, as have clinically observed levels of work/life conflict expressed both by physicians and their spouses. DISCUSSION: We contend that the contemporary rhetoric addressing physicians' psychosocial experience is yielding the iatrogenic effect of promoting work ambivalence, which is a key building block in fostering physician burnout and its sequelae. We propose that curbing physician burnout requires a combination of empathy about the plight of physicians today, compassion that fuels workplace redesigns and family support, and self-compassion on the part of individual physicians. CONCLUSION(S): Both clinical experience and research suggest that physician well-being can be enhanced by coaching physicians to protect positive engagement in their work while practicing resilience-enhancing tactics and strategies.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the consequences of workplace stressors on healthcare clinicians in PICU, and strategies for personal well-being, and professional effectiveness in providing high-quality end-of-life care. DATA SOURCES: Literature review, clinical experience, and expert opinion. STUDY SELECTION: A sampling of foundational and current evidence was accessed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Narrative review and experiential reflection. CONCLUSION(S): The well-being of healthcare clinicians in the PICU influences the day-to-day quality and effectiveness of patient care, team functioning, and the retention of skilled individuals in the PICU workforce. End-of-life care, including decision making, can be complicated. Both are major stressors for PICU staff that can lead to adverse personal and professional consequences. Overresponsiveness to routine stressors may be seen in those with moral distress, and underresponsiveness may be seen in those with compassion fatigue or burnout. Ideally, all healthcare professionals in PICU can rise to the day-to-day workplace challenges-responding in an adaptive, effective manner. Strategies to proactively increase resilience and well-being include self-awareness, self-care, situational awareness, and education to increase confidence and skills for providing end-of-life care. Reactive strategies include case conferences, prebriefings in ongoing preidentified situations, debriefings, and other postevent meetings. Nurturing a culture of practice that acknowledges the emotional impacts of pediatric critical care work and celebrates the shared experiences of families and clinicians to build resilient, effective, and professionally fulfilled healthcare professionals thus enabling the provision of high-quality end-of-life care for children and their families.

N2  - PURPOSE: We describe the psychological strategies (PS) used by a specialized military population, US Navy explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), during training and military operations. We also aim to establish the relationship between PS and resilience. METHOD(S): The Test of Performance Strategies was adapted to the military environment and subsequently was administered to 58 EOD Operators in conjunction with the 10-item Connor- Davidson Resilience Scale. Differences between high- and low-resilience Operators for PS were evaluated with discriminant models. RESULT(S): The PS of EOD Operators were comparable to those of Olympic athletes described in our prior study. The most frequently used strategies during training and military operations were goal setting and emotional control. Discriminant analysis indicated an overall difference between high- and low-resilience Operators with respect to the six training subscales (rho < .05), with goal setting, emotional control, and attentional control contributing most to the discriminant function. CONCLUSION(S): EOD Operators' use of PS was comparable to that of elite athletes. We provide evidence that more-resilient EOD Operators differ from their less resilient counterparts in the strategies they use. These findings have implications for mental preparation strategies used during military training and operations.Copyright 2019.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and initiation of dialysis treatment is reported to be stressful for patients. It is essential that patients use effective coping strategies to deal with these stressors, since ineffective coping could have several adverse effects on various treatment-related as well as personal aspects of life, thereby lowering the quality of life in these patients. The study used a quasi-experimental design. The study population comprised 100 adult patients with Stage 3 and Stage 4 CKD whose glomerular filtration rate was deteriorating and required to undergo hemodialysis (HD) treatment. Carver's Brief Cope Scale was used to assess coping strategies used. The study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital in Bengaluru, India. Patients in the intervention group received pre-HD preparatory program and those in the control group received standard care. Postassessment for coping strategies used was carried out two weeks after the delivery of intervention. Highly significant statistical differences were observed in the use of certain adaptive coping strategies among the experimental group as compared to the control group after implementation of pre-HD preparatory program. These adaptive coping strategies included self-distraction (P = 0.011), active coping (P = 0.000), planning (P = 0.026), acceptance (P = 0.001), and religion (P = 0.005). The intervention was not found to be significant in reducing use of maladaptive coping strategies (P = 0.095). In India, 61%-66% of patients who present to nephrologists are already in end-stage renal disease. These patients hardly receive any organized education that would prepare them to understand their disease and enable them to manage it to the best of their abilities. An ongoing patient education and counseling program led by trained nurse educator will help patients cope effectively with the diagnosis of CKD and its treatment.

T1  - INNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT PATH OF CULTURAL SOFT POWER FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
T3  - Psychology Congress 2021. Virtual.
A1  - Du G. 
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Background: Positive psychology holds that positive psychology is the inner driving force for human survival and development. It pays attention to cultivating and mobilizing the positive force in human nature. At present, the study of positive psychology mainly focuses on positive experience, positive personality and positive organizational system, in which positive experience refers to the emotional experience of satisfaction with the past, happiness with the present and hope for the future; positive personality mainly refers to optimism, self-determinism, positive quality, creativity, persistence and virtue; and positive organizational system mainly refers to the environmental conditions that affect the happiness, development and realization of talent of human beings. Cultural soft power is an important concept widely concerned in recent years. This concept emphasizes that a country's comprehensive national strength includes not only "hard power" such as economy, science and technology, and military, but also "soft power" such as culture, education, ideology, political values, and national quality. Nowadays, culture is becoming more and more an important source of national cohesion and creativity, and an important factor in the competition of comprehensive national strength. If any nation or country wants to win the initiative in the fierce international competition, it must strengthen its economic strength, scientific and technological strength and military strength as well as cultural soft power. Enhancing the soft power of national culture is a systematic project and a long-term task. Objective(s): National cultural soft power is composed of cultural value attraction, cultural knowledge productivity, cultural system guidance and cultural industry competitiveness. Positive psychology can mobilize people's enthusiasm according to their personality and psychological state, promote people to change, and promote the promotion of national cultural soft power. Therefore, from the perspective of positive psychology, it is of practical significance to analyze the path of innovation in upgrading national cultural soft power. Subjects and methods: Because the evaluation index of national cultural soft power is too complicated, this paper takes an enterprise as an example to discuss the effect of positive psychology on the promotion of corporate cultural soft power. In fact, enterprise staff occupy a large proportion of the population of each country. If the cultural soft power of enterprise staff is improved, the national cultural soft power will also be improved to a certain extent. Study design: A total of 300 employees from 20 enterprises in a city were randomly divided into two groups. There was almost no difference in personality, achievement, gender and initial cultural soft power between the two groups. Two groups of enterprises were respectively corresponding to the observation group and the control group. The observation group considered positive psychology and guided students in the view of positive psychology. The control group only carried out ordinary operation. In the observation group, the positive psychological guidance is mainly provided in the form of happiness classes, positive environment and self-help activities, including the topics of how to obtain happiness, healthy body and mind, satisfaction, sense of humor, sense of achievement and eternal friendship, etc., and the positive quality of enterprise employees is closely centered, and the active intervention of enterprise system is transformed into the daily behavior of employees through theoretical guidance and practical training, extending from enterprise work and life experiments to daily practice, so as to cultivate employees' positive feelings such as happiness, self-confidence, love, optimism and resilience. From the aspects of organization management, mechanism construction, atmosphere creation, resource supply and so on, a three-dimensional model of soft power cultivation is established. Method(s): After one month, the cultural soft power differences between the two groups were compared. Cultural soft power, cultural value attraction, cultural knowledge productivity, cultural system guidance and cultural industry competitiveness were used as indicators to compare the status of cultural soft power of different groups. Result(s): The average values of specific cultural soft power evaluation results are shown in Table 1. The cultural soft power of the observation group is significantly higher than that of the control group, and the evaluation values of the other 4 indicators are also higher than that of the control group. Conclusion(s): Cultural soft power is an important concept that has received much attention in recent years. This concept emphasizes that a country's comprehensive national strength includes not only "hard power" such as economy, science and technology, and military, but also "soft power" such as culture, education, ideology, political values, and national quality. In order to improve national cultural soft power, we can focus on the following aspects: developing cultural productivity. To promote our cultural soft power, we must break through the bondage of those inappropriate cultural concepts, vigorously promote the reform of cultural system and develop cultural productivity. Strengthen leadership, improve the scientific level of promoting cultural reform and development; build a public cultural service system; build an excellent traditional cultural inheritance system; pay attention to the development of cultural productivity; promote the national culture to the world; pay attention to cultural communication, innovate ways and means of external publicity, and build a humanistic exchange mechanism.

T1  - INFLUENCE OF OIL PAINTING ART ON THE PSYCHOTHERAPY OF PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION
T3  - Psychology Congress 2021. Virtual.
A1  - Zheng J. 
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Background: Depression is a psychology-originated, comprehensive mental and physical disease. At present, the treatment of depression is mostly carried out in the form of speech psychotherapy plus drug therapy, but there are problems such as low treatment efficiency and insignificant effect. Under such circumstances, "art therapy" has been used as a means of psychotherapy in the United States, Japan and other countries and has achieved remarkable results. However, the most primitive painting art therapy did not use oil painting tools as a method of psychotherapy. Oil painting art is a kind of rehabilitation training method that has good compliance and can effectively improve patients' depressive symptoms. Color psychology research shows that certain colors can play a different degree of psychological adjustment to patients with mental illness. However, there are no relevant reports about the intervention of oil painting psychology in the process of painting training for depressed patients. To this end, research the influence of oil painting art on the psychotherapy of patients with depression. Objective(s): This article discusses the influence of oil painting art as a treatment method on the psychological state of patients with depression, and analyzes the treatment effect with depression as an example, in order to create more suitable treatment methods for the increasing number of depression patients. Subjects and methods: From October 2018 to April 2019, psychotherapy was given to 30 depressive patients who met the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for depressive episodes in the outpatient or inpatient department of a hospital. All patients with Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores >=17 points, support their choice of medication, require no other psychotherapy, and are willing to accept the author's psychotherapy, and sign an informed consent. Among them, 15 were males and 15 were females, ranging in age from 18 to 65, with an average of (30.5+/-11.5) years old. The lowest education level was junior high school, the highest was a doctorate degree, 5 were in college or graduate school, and 4 were suspended due to illness. There were 7 participating workers, 9 unmarried, 5 married, and 2 divorced. There were 13 outpatients and 17 inpatients. The shortest course of disease is 3 months, the longest is 5 years, and the average is (32.3+/-27.6) months. Among the patients with depression, 8 cases were combined with dysthymia. Study design: Divide the subjects into an experimental group and a control group. The training program of the experimental group is to provide oil painting training on the basis of maintenance medication and routine mental care. The training is carried out in the recreation room. A qualified nurse will guide the patient to train, distribute painting materials, and the patient can fill in and draw freely. The color number gradually increases. There are 5 training sessions per week, each training 30~60 min, continuous training 5 week. The training program of the control group: only maintenance of medication and routine care of mental illness, no oil painting intervention training. Methods of statistical analysis: Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) was used to evaluate the depression state of patients before treatment. HAMD and CGI-GI were used to evaluate the clinical efficacy before the end of treatment. The clinical efficacy was evaluated according to CGI grade 4 (markedly effective, effective, slightly effective, ineffective). The "deterioration" of CGI-GI clinical symptoms was used as the recurrence index. The overall health and social function, treatment status and recurrence were followed up. Use SPSS13.0 software for data processing and statistical analysis. According to the nature of the data, t-tests were performed for independent samples and paired samples. Result(s): After the treatment of 30 patients with depression, the effective rate of treatment for all patients was 66.7%. After tracking the recovery of the subjects for 1 year, the recurrence rate was 21.4% within one year, and they were all patients in the control group. The general health and social function status of the experimental group subjects were good. Except for one case with Parkinson's disease, the rest were good, and they were competent for work or study. The control group and the experimental group were subjected to independent sample t-tests in the course of disease, number of treatments, treatment span time, HAMD before treatment, HAMD after treatment, and CGI-GI. The results are shown in Table 1. The results showed that the HAMD score of depression patients was significantly reduced after treatment, indicating that oil painting treatment can significantly reduce the HAMD depression score. Intervention of oil painting art therapy in the treatment of depression can help adjust or improve the emotional state of depressed patients. The results of the study show that rehabilitation intervention training for patients with depression through oil painting art therapy can improve the cognitive function of patients. (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): The results of this study further show that the art of oil painting has a significant impulse inhibition effect on patients with depression, and has good clinical application value. It is helpful for patients to reflect deeply, find problems, solve problems, and have a deeper understanding and cognition of false suicidal concepts and behaviors that occurred in the past. However, in the course of clinical operation, we also found that the factors of whether oil painting art therapy can achieve good results also include: the on-site operation level of the treatment staff and the stability of their own performance, the degree of awareness and attention of the family members to the disease, and the personality of the patient whether there are defects and other factors related. How to train therapists, how to distinguish and treat different groups of people, to maximize the role of oil painting art therapy, and to suppress the impulse of suicide are also subjects of joint research by the majority of psychological colleagues.

N2  - PURPOSE: To develop a culturally-tailored American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) women's Facebook group supporting opioid recovery as an adjunct to medication. DESIGN: Community-based, qualitative approach. SETTING: Minnesota, U.S. PARTICIPANTS: AI/AN women in opioid recovery, interested parties, and a Community Advisory Committee (CAC) of AI/AN women with lived experience, health care providers, and community members. INTERVENTION: We developed evidence-based content focusing on stress/trauma and substance use, mindfulness, responding to triggers, and supportive community resources. Additional content centered on AI/AN culture was also selected. METHOD(S): Interviews were conducted by two women, then transcribed and coded using content analysis with NVivo software. Results were presented to CAC for further content refinement. RESULT(S): CAC members (n = 10) guided study methods, intervention development, and dissemination activities. 14 AI/AN women (mean age 36.4 years; mean 6.7 months opioid abstinence) and 12 interested parties (7 men, 5 women) were receptive to an AI/AN gender-specific Facebook group, preferring content with AI/AN people and/or text resonating with AI/AN culture (e.g., Native traditions, family, personal stories, historical trauma). Recommendations included (1) protect confidentiality, (2) retain positivity, (3) incorporate resources and exercises to build coping skills, and (4) moderators should be authentic and relatable to build trust. CONCLUSION(S): Our approach provides a model for developing culturally tailored, appealing and effective social media interventions to support AI/AN women in recovery from opioid use disorder.

T1  - Reducing the drivers of drug demand in English towns by understanding risk and resilience in the community and developing a framework for partnership action: a mixed methods analysis
A1  - Whitehead R.
A1  - Wells C. 
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Substance misuse has extensive effects on individuals and communities, ranging from the poor health of people who use drugs to the pressure placed on health care, social services, and the criminal justice system. Strategies to curtail the supply and demand of drugs and reduce these effects typically focus on supply, with less emphasis placed on the drivers of demand. We piloted and evaluated a public health approach for understanding the drivers and effects of substance misuse in a local area, and how these might be targeted for prevention through multi-agency partnership action. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional mixed methods analysis was conducted, using multi-agency data. 3 years of data provided by criminal justice agencies (police, youth justice, and probation), drug treatment services, social care, education, and hospitals were used to profile the local demand and effect of drugs on individuals and communities in a coastal town in southern England. The experiences of local professionals who support people who misuse drugs, or people affected by drug misuse, were collected via an online survey that was disseminated to relevant partnership organisations, including homelessness charities and drug treatment providers. A public health framework identifying relevant risk and resilience factors in the community was developed by combining the multi-agency data and survey responses The methodological efficacy of this approach to inform partnership action was evaluated via a survey with the project's stakeholders. FINDINGS: Community housing, mental health, and cycles entrenching substance misuse were identified as risk factors that increase individual-level, interpersonal-level, and community-level vulnerabilities to the harms of drug misuse, violence, and exploitation. Evaluation found this mixed-methods analysis for understanding risk and resilience to be a valuable approach to enable public health and community safety leaders to develop a framework for partnership action to reduce the negative effects of drug demand in the community. INTERPRETATION: Analysis of multi-agency data helped to further a shared understanding in local partners of the drivers and effects of drug demand at a local level; and, through a public health lens, clearly identified the role that local organisations can play in minimising the harms of substance misuse and exploitation.

T1  - Substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic: What is really happening?
A1  - Mellos E.
A1  - Paparrigopoulos T. 
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased levels of anxiety, fear, sadness, difficulty adjusting, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidality, both in the general population and specific subgroups. The presence of this type of psychopathology increases the risk of involvement with or worsens the use of addictive substances and alcohol as a maladaptive coping strategy.1 According to these data, people with substance use disorders are a population at high risk for COVID-19 infection and serious illness. A large controlled retrospective case study in the US found that people with substance use disorders are significantly more vulnerable to COVID-19 and its complications (primarily those with opioid use disorder OR = 10.21 and with tobacco use disorder OR = 8.25), and that the course and outcome of the disease (hospitalization, death) was worse than in non-dependent individuals. The main culprits are increased physical co-morbidity (frequent respiratory and cardiovascular problems), poor health and living conditions, marginalization and difficulties in accessing health services. 2,3 International epidemiological data during the first months of the pandemic regarding the use of addictive substances do not lead to safe conclusions. A cross-sectional online epidemiological study conducted on a sample of 36,538 adults from 21 European countries between April and July 2020 found an overall decrease in alcohol use, which was mainly attributed to the reduction of heavy episodic consumption, while at the same time an increase in alcohol consumption among people with severe alcohol use was recorded. The use of cannabis and nicotine showed increasing trends, as well as the use of cocaine, but to a lesser extent, while the use of MDMA (ecstasy) showed a decrease.4 In a review of 45 cross-sectional studies conducted between December 2019 and November 2020, alcohol use was on the rise overall, despite geographical variations, as was the use of other addictive substances, cannabis in particular.5 It should be noted that those who increased alcohol use during quarantine were those exhibiting higher levels of negative emotionality mechanisms.6 In Greece, an online cross-sectional survey in April 2020 in the general population during the first lockdown showed a reduction in alcohol use (43.7% of alcohol users reduced or quit), a reduction in cannabis (67.3% quit), while 33.3% increased nicotine use. These changes were attributed to the limitation of alcohol availability, social distancing, changes in daily routine and income reduction.7,8 Also, wastewater samples from Athens, analyzed by the Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry of EKPA, showed a significant increase in the use of cocaine (67%), amphetamine (350%) and methamphetamine (37%), and a decrease in the use of MDMA (- 38%) during the first lockdown, compared to the corresponding period of the previous year.9 Analysis of wastewater samples from other European cities "suggest that levels of use of most drugs appear generally lower during the initial lockdowns, but then appear to bounce back once lockdown was lifted. A comparison with 2019 appears to suggest similar overall consumption of most drugs, and in several cities possibly even higher levels, based on this data source. Exceptions here appear to be MDMA and methamphetamine, two drugs for which the levels observed in 2020 appear lower in most of the participating cities".10,11 There were also changes in the locations of use of the substances, as with the periodic restrictions the use was transferred mainly at home and in open public spaces; in some cases, it was associated with increased intravenous use and cases of intoxication. Finally, intermittent difficulties in drug availability and trafficking have led users to search for other substances, increase experimentation and multidrug use, and make online purchases. In addition, there is concern about the increasing abuse of benzodiazepines, which are either diverted from therapeutic use or appear on the illicit market, often as new benzodiazepines.10,12 According to the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), "the drug market has been remarkably resilient to disruption caused by the pandemic" ... Drug trafficking has adapted to the new conditions with changes in routes and methods of trafficking, and by further enhancing the digital presence of the drug market... "Any reductions in drug consumption seen during the initial lockdowns rapidly disappeared as social distancing measures were eased. In general terms, there appears to have been less consumer interest in drugs usually associated with recreational events, such as MDMA, and greater interest in drugs linked with home use. However, the easing of restrictions ... during the summer was associated with a rebound in the levels of use". Also, "survey data suggest that those using drugs occasionally prior to COVID-19 may have reduced or even ceased their use during the pandemic, but more-regular users may have increased their drug consumption".10 Measures taken to control the pandemic have reduced and modified the mental health and addiction treatment services provided. Although services have been adequately restored, there has initially been a 60% reduction in the availability and provision of detoxification services in Europe.13 Live contact, mainly at group level, was significantly reduced or stopped altogether for a long period, as well as the frequency of individual appointments. Therapeutic programs sought to respond to the new conditions using technology and telemedicine, providing online group support and psychotherapy. Substitution treatment programs have become more flexible by providing long-term pharmaceutical substitutes (take home) to prevent users from moving. There have also been facilitations in prescribing by treating physicians. Thus, the addicts' contact with the treatment process was maintained, but it was insufficient to meet their increased needs during this period. In conclusion, it should be noted that substance use appears to have an autonomous dynamism in relation to the pandemic and the consequent psychopathology, being in a "loose" causal relationship with it. Therefore, hasty and untimely generalizations should be avoided, and easy conclusions should not be drawn through extrapolations from previous socio-economic crises of different types or through partial spatiotemporal understandings, which are usually presented by the media in the form of negative alarming information.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for surgeons. BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals have alarmingly high rates of burnout, yet little is known about psychological factors that support resilience. MBIs, which involve codified training in specific skills such as self-awareness, emotional regulation, and perspective-taking, have shown benefit to professionals in high stress environments, but have had limited implementation in the healthcare workplace and in surgery. To our knowledge, there has not been a scoping review of MBIs in surgery to date. METHOD(S): We conducted a scoping review of the evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of MBIs for surgeons, including evidence on interventions that explicitly train mindfulness, which spans multiple cohorts and settings, utilizing different methodologies and outcome measures. RESULT(S): This scoping review yielded 24 studies, including two mixed method/qualitative studies, nine randomized control trials, three non-randomized interventional studies, and eight single-arm interventional studies. CONCLUSION(S): We find that MBIs in surgery 1) are feasible in surgical contexts, with implementation science providing insights on sustainability; 2) increase mindfulness, 3) improve well-being in terms of burnout and both psychological and neurophysiological measures of stress, and 4) enhance performance as measured in executive function, surgical skills, and communication skills. These conclusions are supported by psychometric measures, observations of technical skills, and neurophysiological evidence. Future directions include studying MBIs in larger and more diverse populations, and iteratively tailoring mindfulness-based interventions to other healthcare contexts.Copyright Â© 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Background: Burnout amongst healthcare professionals has been well-documented as a phenomenon that compromises the quality and viability of patient-centered care, particularly in oncology. Due to the extraordinary demands of the pandemic, burnout has emerged as a public health crisis that warrants immediate attention to preserve the wellbeing of healthcare staff. At the onset of the pandemic, The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC) at Jefferson, an urban NCI-designated cancer center, translated its support offerings to virtual events. Initially, healthcare providers (HP) sought support by attending patient programs. In response, SKCC initiated virtual programming to support the well-being and needs of the HP team. Method(s):Within weeks of the state shutdown due to the pandemic, programs were initiated to address HP self-reported distress: Coping Effectively and Mindfulness Moments Each 30-minute session was facilitated by a licensed psychologist and social worker. Coping Effectively offers strategies from evidence based treatment including Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, to cope with distress and burnout. Mindful Moments draws from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction practices including observing breath and guided meditations. These programs have been offered consistently throughout the pandemic. Schwartz Rounds, geared towards supporting the human side of healthcare, provided 'hot' topic moderated discussions, four of which focused on the pandemic These discussions allow for HP to come together to discuss difficult topics and emotions impacting a variety of professionals. All programming was evaluated with a single question to measure the impact of the session on reducing distress. Each program began and ended with a poll asking, 'How distressed do you currently feel?' Attendees respond on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, in which10 indicated the highest level of distress. Result(s): Since March 31 , 340 staff have attended Mindful Moments and 236 staff have attended Coping Effectively. From March 2020- February 2021, 382 attendees measured their distress before and after attending a staff program. Schwartz Rounds hosted 471 HP from a variety of disciplines. Participants were asked to complete an evaluation following rounds. 31% of program participants' completed an evaluation form and 89% rated the program exceptional/very good. Conclusion(s): Despite the challenges of COVID-19, the pivot to virtually create programs to support staff during the pandemic was swift and thoughtful. The increased attendance and the feedback from evaluations are promising indicators of decreasing burnout amongst HP. How Distressed do you Currently Feel? (Average Score scale 1-10).

N2  - BACKGROUND: It has been established that residents face high rates of burnout and depression. This issue was highlighted in the recent Canadian Medical Association National Physician Health Survey, with resident rates of burnout as much as 38% and positive depression screen in 48% of resident respondents (Canadian Medical Association 2018). Evidence is limited regarding the impact of interventions (West et al. 2016). Many current interventions focus on developing resilience on an individual basis and are not always generalizable to the specific context a medical trainee is working in. OBJECTIVE(S): The objective of this study was to assess the wellness needs of local Paediatric Medicine trainees. DESIGN/METHODS: A needs assessment of current trainees was conducted utilizing an appreciative inquiry approach, a qualitative method of organizational development to understand transformational change from a positive light (Hennessy, 2014). Qualitative responses were collected through a REDCap survey, which was distributed electronically. Responses were coded by three members of the project team and overarching themes were identified. Survey questions asked trainees to reflect on a difficult time where they emerged resilient, what exists in the learning environment that promotes resilience, what are the characteristics of an ideal learning environment and what changes need to be done to achieve such an environment. Survey respondents were also asked to select what formal wellness initiatives they would find helpful. RESULT(S): 32 of 86 residents (37%) completed the survey. Paediatric medicine trainees reported feeling supported by individual relationships, but sought additional opportunities to share experiences and grow from structured activities Participants reported wanting a shift in the structure of the learning environment to create scaffolding for optimal resident learning. Participants also shared that they would like an opportunity to meet their basic needs both at work and in their lives, including physical health, mental health, and psychological safety. Finally, participants envisioned a positive shift in the culture of medicine that would help mitigate the demands created by structural barriers in the learning environment. CONCLUSION(S): This project highlights key areas to target in the development of wellness programming and underlines the need for structural and cultural change in medical training and learning environments to support the wellbeing of paediatric medicine trainees in their local environment.

N2  - Background: Frailty is associated with worse outcomes and higher healthcare costs. The long waiting time for surgery is a potential 'teachable' moment. We examined the feasibility and safety of a pilot prehabilitation programme on high-risk frail patients undergoing major elective surgery. Method(s): A single-centre, retrospective pilot study (Dec 2020-Nov 2021) on a one-stop prehabilitation programme (structured exercise training, nutritional counselling/therapy, and psychological support) in collaboration with geriatricians and allied health professionals. At least 4 weeks before surgery, patients at high risk of frailty or malnutrition, or undergoing major hepatectomy, esophagectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy, or radical cystectomy, were referred for prehabilitation (2-3 sessions/week). The primary outcomes were the feasibility and safety of prehabilitation. The secondary outcomes were changes in functional, emotional, and nutritional status and days alive and at home within 30 days after surgery (DAH30) associated with prehabilitation. Result(s): Over a 12-month period, 72 out of 111 patients (64.9%) from the Perioperative Medicine Clinic were eligible for prehabilitation, of which 54 (75%) were recruited. The mean (standard deviation) age was 71.9 (6.9) years. The adherence rate to 3 weeks of prehabilitation was high in 52 (96.3%) participants. Prehabilitation improved exercise capacity (P = 0.08), enhanced some functional mobility measures (P = 0.02), and increased nutritional energy (P = 0.04) and protein intakes (P < 0.01). However, prehabilitation-related changes in muscle strength, cognitive function, and emotional resilience were minimal. The median (interquatile range) DAH30 was 19 (14-23) days. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion(s): This outpatient-based, one-stop multidisciplinary prehabilitation programme was feasible, safe, and improved several measures of patient's physiological reserve and functional capacity.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this qualitative study was to describe key themes discussed by student pharmacists and preceptors related to recognizing burnout and maintaining wellbeing during an experiential assignment. METHOD(S): This qualitative study used directed content analysis to examine themes that emerged from discussions between student pharmacists and preceptors as part of a required lifelong learning interview during Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences that took place between August 2019 and May 2020. Iterative axial coding was used to develop and redefine codes systematically until consensus was reached and a final codebook was established. All responses were coded using the consensus categories. RESULT(S): From the 228 interviews analyzed, 3 overarching themes emerged: causes of burnout, manifestations or symptoms of burnout, and strategies to manage stress and burnout. Preceptors identified the mechanics of the job and feeling extreme pressure or worry as 2 major causes of burnout, which manifest as physical exhaustion, mental exhaustion, and poor work performance. To manage stress, preceptors reported using personal and work-positive coping strategies. CONCLUSION(S): The major themes derived from the analysis-causes of burnout, manifestations of burnout, and strategies to manage stress-align with what is already known about health care provider wellbeing. Although it remains unknown if this type of wellness intervention is effective at changing student stress management habits, results indicate that the intervention sparked conversations that could assist students in establishing a baseline of knowledge on the topic and supply students with a toolkit of resiliency strategies.Copyright Â© 2023 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.

N2  - Introduction: The value of psychological principles has become apparent in medical settings, especially with the rise of patient-centered care. We aimed to provide a curriculum informing medical providers about the theoretical basis and clinical utility of the social-cognitive model of stress and coping. Method(s): This workshop was delivered to an interprofessional team of faculty and trainees. Our initial pedagogical approach was to relate the concepts of cognitive appraisals and coping strategies to participants' own stress responses. We then used didactic presentation and small-group activities to explore ways to promote adaptive coping with patients to improve health outcomes. Learners participated in a mindfulness exercise, conceptualized coping strategies given a hypothetical case scenario, and, in small groups, role-played a patient encounter to construct an effective coping repertoire for the patient. Participants completed a prework self-assessment and workshop evaluation form. Result(s): The 2.5-hour workshop had 48 participants from five professions (medicine, education, physician assistant, pharmacology, psychology). We received 35 evaluations (73% response rate). Learners reported increased real-world skills (M = 8.0 out of 10) and feeling better prepared for working in interprofessional settings (M = 7.6 out of 10). Qualitative feedback suggested that participants recognized the importance of individual differences in coping with stress and felt they could categorize strategies into emotion- or problem-focused coping. Discussion(s): This workshop provided participants with basic knowledge about the social-cognitive model of stress and coping and allowed them to practice newly learned skills in a role-play as an interprofessional medical care team.Copyright Â© 2023 Stuhlmann et al.

N2  - ABSTRACT: With about one-third of nurses having expressed an intention to leave the profession or change jobs in 2022, the effects of nursing job stress are evident. For nurses to continue to provide care in high stress, they must practice self-compassion and build resilience. The importance of resilience education and self-compassion for nurses and in nursing education is discussed from a Christian perspective, along with self-care strategies using the R.E.S.T. (Relationship, Exercise, Self-Compassion, Transformative Thinking) framework. Strategies for building resilience for both individuals and organizations are offered.Copyright Â© 2023 InterVarsity Christian Fellowship.

N2  - : To explore the potential associations between perceived stress and health-promoting behaviors based on the theoretical schema of the middle-range theory of adaptation to chronic illness. From January to May 2021, a convenience sampling method was used to recruit 230 young and middle-aged patients with metabolic syndrome who underwent physical examination in the inpatient center of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The Health-Promoting Health Profile-II, Chinese Perceived Stress Scale, Coping and Adaptation Processing Scale-Short Form, and Multi-dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were used in the cross-sectional study. The chain mediation effect procedure and bootstrap sampling test were used to examine the mediating role of adaptability and social support between perceived stress and health-promoting behaviors. The mean score of health-promoting behaviors was 100.0+/-14.6, the mean score of perceived stress was 22.0+/- 6.9, the mean score of adaptability was 47.0+/-6.1, and the mean score of social support was 63.8+/-10.8. Perceived stress had a negative impact on patients' health-promoting behaviors (=-0.309, <0.05). The adaptability (effect size= -0.112, 95%:-0.199~-0.038) and social support (effect size= -0.032, 95%:-0.083~played a mediating role and a chain mediating role in the process of perceived stress influencing patients' health-promoting behaviors (effect size= -0.045, 95%:-0.093~-0.020). Adaptability and social support play an intermediary role between perceived stress and health-promoting behaviors in young and middle-aged patients with metabolic syndrome. Healthcare professionals can motivate patients to develop healthy behaviors by developing intervention strategies on adaptability and social support.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate how moral injury (MI), traumatic experiences and daily stressors were related to the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and International Classification of Diseases 11th revision specific complex PTSD (CPTSD) symptoms of disturbances in self-organisation (DSO) in a treatment-seeking sample of nurses. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nurses from all regions of Lithuania participated in the study. The data were collected between April and May 2021. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 206 nurses, mean age 42.34 years (SD=11.68), 97.1% women and with 65% >10 years of work experience. RESULT(S): The prevalence of PTSD and CPTSD in the treatment-seeking sample of nurses was 9.2% and 10.2%, respectively. The results of structural equation modelling indicated an acceptable model fit for the model regarding the links between trauma exposure, daily stressors, MI, PTSD and DSO symptoms, (chi2 (df)=219.718 (123), p<0.001, Comparative Fit Index/Tucker-Lewis Index=0.937/0.922, root mean square error of approximation (90%CI)=0.062 (0.048 to 0.075), standardised root mean square residual=0.049). MI had a large effect on DSO symptoms, beta=0.667, p<0.001, and a medium effect on PTSD symptoms, beta=0.394, p<0.001. Daily stress but not trauma exposure was significantly related to MI, beta=0.618, p<0.001. CONCLUSION(S): The prevalence of PTSD and CPTSD in a treatment-seeking sample of nurses inform healthcare administrators, policymakers and medical staff about the demand for psychosocial interventions for healthcare workers focused on stress management to address their daily stressors and mitigate effects on MI or trauma-focused treatments for PTSD/CPTSD.

N2  - Background: Studies examining mitigating factors associated with residents' experience of burnout have found mixed results; thus the most effective approaches for programs to prevent resident burnout are unclear. Objective(s): We used mixed methods to explore the association of 4 psychological constructs thought to be important protective factors for burnout-grit, resiliency, social support, and psychological flexibility-across a wide variety of residency programs at 1 institution. Method(s):  The explanatory sequential study design included an online survey of previously published scales measuring burnout, grit, resiliency, social support, and psychological flexibility. The survey was sent to 20 residency programs in a single institution during the 2017-2018 academic year. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and ordinal logistic regressions to determine the association of protective factors and demographic variables. Interviews with 13 residents were conducted and analyzed deductively and inductively to identify when and how residents employed the protective factors. Result(s): Among the 268 responders (51% response rate), grit, resiliency, social support, and psychological flexibility were individually inversely associated with burnout level. However, resiliency and relationship status were no longer associated with burnout when all 4 factors were included in the model. Interviews revealed that grit both protects from and contributes to burnout, residents prefer peer support, and they cognitively "step back" when stress is high. Conclusion(s): Although many programs and institutions focus on resiliency in wellness programs, there may be other factors to consider, such as grit and equipping students with tools to disengage psychologically when feeling stressed or overwhelmed.Copyright Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education 2020.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Gastric cancer patients undergoing total gastrectomy face nutrition-related complications and worsening quality of life after surgery. In this context, gastrectomized cancer patients are required to cope with new conditions. Little is known about their accommodating feeding to the new life condition as a negotiated process among stakeholders in real contexts. This study aimed to investigate the shaping of this process as influenced by the perspectives of patients, health-care professionals (HPs), and caregivers (CGs). METHOD(S): A constructivist grounded theory study, through semi-structured interviews and interpretative coding, was designed to answer the following research question: "what is the process of returning to eating and feeding after a gastrectomy?" RESULTS: The final sample included 18 participants. "Defining a balance by compromising with fear" is the core category explaining returning to eating as a process negotiated by all actors involved, with patients trying to find a feeding balance through a multi-layer compromise: with the information received by HPs, the proprioception drastically altered by gastric resection, new dietary habits to accept, and complex and often minimized conviviality. This process involves 4 main conceptual phases: relying on the doctors' advice, perceptive realignment, rearranging food intake, and food-regulated social interaction. Those categories are also shaped by the fear of being unwell from eating and the constant fear of tumor relapse. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Multiple actors can meet patients' and their CGs' nutritional, care, and psychosocial needs. A multidisciplinary approach involving nutritionists, psychologists, occupational therapists, social workers, and anthropologists can be key to effectively managing these patients' survivorship care. We suggest training all the professionals on the first level of nutritional counseling.

N2  - Agriculture producers are less likely to seek or to receive mental health services compared to the general population. Additional research is needed to identify effective and accessible mental health interventions for this underserved population. This study used a mixed-methods approach and open trial design to examine the acceptability and effectiveness of therapist-assisted internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) supplemented with an additional agricultural resource for clients from agricultural backgrounds receiving ICBT in routine care. Clients (n = 34) participated in an online, five-lesson course that provided psychoeducation and strategies for dealing with symptoms of anxiety and depression, with weekly therapist assistance. Clients also received a tailored resource (developed with input from those with an agricultural background) providing culturally specific information and case stories pertinent to agricultural communities. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that the ICBT program was effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms among the agricultural population. Large within-group pre-to-post-treatment Cohen's effect sizes of d = 1.14, 95 % CI [0.41, 1.86] and d = 1.15, 95 % CI [0.42, 1.87] were found for depression and anxiety, respectively and comparable to the same program offered to the general population. Clients also experienced reductions in perceived stress and significant improvements in resiliency from pre- to post-treatment. Semi-structured interviews conducted at post-treatment with the agricultural clients (n = 31) on their experiences with ICBT identified four main themes: perceived strengths of ICBT and the tailored resource, suggestions to improve service delivery for agriculture producers, clients experienced internal and external challenges to participating in ICBT, and the positive impact of the course reached beyond the client. Very high satisfaction rates were found. These results provide support for the acceptability and effectiveness of ICBT with a tailored resource offered in routine care among agriculture producers.Copyright Â© 2024 The Authors

N2  - Background: This study sought to investigate the prevalence of anxiety, depression and mixed anxiety-depression disorder among college students during COVID-19 shelter-in-place lockdowns in China. Method(s): Participants (N = 2818) were selected from 8 provincial regions across the country in areas that were under lockdown mandates. The dependent variables were anxiety and depression. Multiple regression models were tested using anxiety and depression as the respective outcome variables, and binary logistic regression was conducted with anxiety-depression comorbidity as the dependent variable. Explanatory variables were changes in (social) media use and communication behaviors, perceived effectiveness of daily activity involvements as well as a number of demographic and environmental factors. Result(s): Being a college senior, prior anxiety/depression history, having family members and residents in neighborhood tested positive with COVID were all important predictors of elevated anxiety, depression and their comorbidity. Increased face-to-face family communication and reading more e-books were associated with reduced anxiety, depression and their comorbidity. Listening to music and playing video games were correlated with lower anxiety but not depression. Conclusion(s): Draconian shelter-in-place lockdowns as strictly enforced in China within a short notice could be detrimental to individual mental health and psychological well-being. Findings in this research can provide practical guidance for college counselors and health professionals in targeting particular segments of the student population in providing tailored psychological, therapeutic and material services during disruptive moments and public health crises. The central role of family communication in the emotional and social support process deserves critical contemplation.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Enhancing resiliency and optimizing readiness in military personnel is a high priority for the U.S. Department of Defense. Most military resiliency-enhancement programs are evidence-informed interventions. However, few randomized studies have demonstrated efficacy of any intervention or training program to enhance resiliency and prevent the development of psychological health symptoms in military personnel when exposed to operational stressors. This manuscript provides an overview of the theoretical foundation, research design, and research methods of a preventive intervention trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of a training program to enhance resiliency and prevent psychological health symptoms in military personnel. The resiliency training intervention is based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an evidence-based intervention with broad empirical support for improving functioning in those living with psychological and medical conditions. Method/design: This study will evaluate the efficacy of a two-day training program based on ACT for fostering psychological flexibility, the central target in ACT, for enhancing resiliency, and for preventing the development of psychological health symptoms. The research participants will be a non-clinical population of active duty military personnel (N = 600). The ACT-based training program (n = 300) will be compared to a military resiliency training as usual, known as Master Resilience Training (n = 300). Assessment measures will be administered at the baseline assessment, after training, prior to a military deployment, and after returning from a deployment. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to provide feedback on the training program.

N2  - Objective: Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had widespread negative impacts on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), there has been little research on psychological interventions during the pandemic for this population. The current study examines whether a brief coping-focused treatment intervention delivered in a virtual individual format would be associated with positive changes in Canadian HCWs' mental health during the pandemic. Method(s): Three hundred and thirty-three HCWs receiving the intervention at 3 large specialty tertiary care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, completed measures of anxiety, depression, perceived stress, work/social impairment, insomnia and fear of COVID-19. After completing treatment, HCWs rated their satisfaction with the treatment. Result(s): The intervention was associated with large effect size improvements in anxiety, depression, perceived stress, insomnia and fear of COVID-19, and moderate effect size improvements in work/social impairment. At treatment session 1, prior mental health diagnosis and treatment were both significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and work/social impairment scores. Secondary analyses of data from one of the sites revealed that treatment-related changes in anxiety, depression, perceived stress and work/social impairment were independent of age, gender, occupational setting, profession and the presence of a previous mental health diagnosis or treatment, with the exception that nurses improved at a slightly greater rate than other professions in terms of work/social impairment. HCWs were highly satisfied with the treatment. Conclusion(s): A large number of HCWs experiencing significant distress at baseline self-referred for assistance. Timely and flexible access to a brief virtual coping-focused intervention was associated with improvements in symptoms and impairment, and treatment response was largely unrelated to demographic or professional characteristics. Short-term psychological interventions for HCWs during a pandemic may have a highly positive impact given their association with improvement in various aspects of HCWs' mental health improvement.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While financial toxicity (FT) is prevalent in patients with cancer, young and middle-aged patients with stroke are also affected by FT, which can exacerbate their physical and psychological challenges. Understanding the patient's experience and response measures can further understand the impact of FT on patients with stroke, to help alleviate FT. However, little is known concerning the experience of patients with stroke with FT or their coping strategies. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the experiences of FT in young and middle-aged patients with stroke and their coping strategies. METHOD(S): A phenomenological method was utilized. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 young and middle-aged stroke patients (aged 18-59) between October 2022 and March 2023. The participants were recruited from a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. The research team used NVivo 12.0 software. Giorgi's phenomenological analysis method was used to analyse the interview data. RESULT(S): The interview results were divided into two categories in terms of patients' experiences of FT and their coping strategies. Nine subthemes were constructed. The experience category included four subthemes: (1) taking on multifaceted economic pressure, (2) dual choice of treatment, (3) decline in material living standards, and (4) suffering from negative emotions such as anxiety and depression. The coping strategy category included five subthemes: (1) reducing expenses, (2) improving living habits, (3) proactive participation in medical decision-making, (4) making a job position choice, and (5) seeking social support. CONCLUSION(S): FT in young and middle-aged patients with stroke, which affected their physical and mental health, led them to implement strategies for dealing with FT. The Chinese government needs to broaden the reach of health insurance coverage and advance the fairness of healthcare policies. Healthcare professionals must pay active attention to FT in such patients in terms of strengthening their health education and considering their needs and preferences. Patients need to improve their sense of self-efficacy, actively reintegrate into society, and adhere to rehabilitation and treatment. Individuals at a high risk of stroke are recommended to purchase health insurance. Multifaceted efforts are needed to reduce the impact of FT in young and middle-aged patients with stroke.Copyright Â© 2024. The Author(s).

N2  - The present research compared internalizing problems of adolescents who experienced parental divorce with those of adolescents who remained in intact families. Furthermore, this research investigated the association of teacher autonomy support with adolescents' internalizing problems for the whole sample and further ascertained whether this association was moderated by distinctive personality profiles using a person-centered approach and family structures (divorced vs. intact families). A sample of 2756 Chinese adolescents (8.5% from divorced families), aged 13-18 years, participated in the present research. They completed a set of self-reported questionnaires during school hours. Results based on ANCOVA showed that adolescents who experienced parental divorce reported higher internalizing problems than did those who remained in intact families. Moreover, latent profile analysis revealed three personality profiles: psychopathic (22.7%), normative (56.4%), and resilient (20.9%). In addition, teacher autonomy support was negatively related to adolescents' internalizing problems in the overall sample. However, interaction analyses further exhibited that this association was insignificant for psychopathic adolescents who experienced parental divorce. The current findings indicate that although teacher autonomy support may protect adolescents from internalizing problems, psychopathic adolescents whose parents got divorced should be paid exceptional attention by mental health professionals and school counselors.Copyright Â© 2022.

N2  - Introduction: Gynecological cancers are long-term, challenging, and stressful diseases. In Turkiye, the majority of patients with gynecological cancer use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Considering the stress that gynecological cancer patients are exposed to, patients need to know how to cope with stress. Objective(s): This study aimed to determine the use of CAM and coping with stress by patients with gynecological cancer and the relationships between them and the factors that predict the approaches to coping with stress in women with gynecological cancer in Turkiye. Method(s): This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study. The study was conducted with 204 patients between April and August 2022. The data of the study were collected by face-to-face interview and filled out by the patients using the Descriptive Information Form and the Stress Coping Styles Scale (SCSS). Number, percentage, mean, chi2, one-way ANOVA, t test, and the Spearman correlation analysis were used in the data analysis. To analyze the multivariate independent associations between variables, a multivariate ordinal logistic regression model was used, with the SCSS domains as dependent variables. A 95% confidence interval was calculated, and all statistical tests had an alpha level of 0.05. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 58.38 +/- 12.64 years (32-80). The prevalence of CAM use by patients was 39.2%, and the most common types of CAM were herbal products (43.8%) and supplication (42.5%). The reasons for using CAM were relaxation (symptomatic)-feeling healthy (63.8%) and treating cancer (36.2%). No statistically significant difference was found between the use of CAM and their approaches to coping with stress (p > 0.05). As a result of multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis, education level under high school, having ovary, cervix, and endometrium cancer, being in the first stage of cancer, receiving chemotherapy, receiving surgical treatment, having another cancer patient in the social environment and increased interest in a partner after the diagnosis of cancer was associated with an effective coping with stress (p < 0.05, adjusted R2 = 0.27, 0.79, and 0.32, respectively). Not working, experiencing an abortion, having another cancer patient in their social environment, being in the third stage of cancer, having an extended family, and living in a rural area of residence were associated with ineffective coping with stress (p < 0.05, adjusted R2 = 0.20 and 0.24, respectively). Conclusion(s): The prevalence of CAM use by patients was low. While determining the approaches of the patients to cope with stress, their education level, place of residence, family type, diagnosis of cancer, stage of cancer, treatment, partner support, and stressful life events should be considered. As nurses, we need to be more knowledgeable about the use of CAM to provide correct guidance to our patients for access to accurate and effective information. We need to determine our patients' stressors and how our patients cope with stress. Copyright Â© 2024 S. Karger AG. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: Evidence exploring the relationship between COVID-19 mitigation measures and mental health has primarily been from quantitative studies in large, developed countries. A qualitative study to explore the knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of young people living in Trinidad and Tobago was conducted to engage and collaborate with youth on matters affecting them during the pandemic. Method(s): Ten virtual focus groups were conducted with 64 participants aged 18 to 24 in 2021 when partial lockdown measures were in effect for COVID-19 prevention. Groups were stratified by geographic location and socioeconomic status. The recordings were transcribed and analyzed to explore themes of importance to youth. Result(s): Negative impacts on mental health emerged as a strong theme. Lack of timelines for restrictions led to wide ranging mental health impacts, conflict and tension existed in home environments, longer restrictions led to erosion of the social culture, and young people experienced stress about the changing face of education and job security due to the pandemic. Discussion(s): Measures taken to address one serious public health concern, COVID-19, led to the aggravation of another serious public health concern, mental ill-health. Mental health initiatives to help young people navigate issues specific to their generation must be developed. In low resourced Small Island Developing States settings. The increased need for mental health services during and because of the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for strengthening the capacity and resilience of these to respond to environmental and health emergencies. Building the resilience of educational and employment services is also needed.Copyright Â© 2024 Murphy, Pemberton, Wheeler, Gulston, Kerr-Layne, John, Baksh, Thomas and Allen.

N2  - Objective: Virtual reality (VR), a novel and highly immersive technology, offers promise in addressing potential psychological impacts of cancer treatments and hospitalization. The primary aim of this study was to examine multiple key user perspectives on the acceptability and feasibility of an Immersive VR therapeutic intervention for use with hospitalized patients with cancer. Secondary aims were to identify issues and opportunities related to the adoption and clinical implementation of VR in pediatric oncology settings. Method(s): The study was conducted at The Royal Children's Hospital (RCH), Melbourne, Australia. Thirty multidisciplinary oncology health care professionals participated in an initial test of VR intervention usability (Stage 1). Ninety oncology inpatients (7-19 years) and their parent caregivers participated in a pilot randomized controlled study to examine the effectiveness of an Immersive VR therapeutic intervention (Stage 2). This mixed methods study reports Stages 1 and 2 quantitative and qualitative data related to VR feasibility and acceptability. Result(s): Results indicate favorable perceptions from health care professionals with respect to ease of use and usefulness of VR, and had positive intentions to use it in the future. Parent caregivers reported high acceptability of VR for their hospitalized child. Patients reported high satisfaction of the VR intervention within minimal adverse effects. Barriers and facilitators to VR use with seriously ill children and specific recommendations for content development were elicited. Conclusion(s): This study shows that there are several potential clinical uses for Immersive VR intervention, beyond medical procedural distraction, to support psychological adjustment to hospitalization and patient quality of life.

N2  - Background: Physician wellness has become a topic of great interest within the medical field as rates of burnout, depression, and career dissatisfaction have increased. This topic is of particular interest in oncology, with 45%-80% of practicing oncologists worldwide reporting symptoms of burnout (Hlubocky et al. ASCO 2017). Despite the growing interest, there are few programs to address these issues in early clinical trainees, specifically hematology oncology fellows. Mindfulness is a strategy that can be used to recognize and cope with stress and burnout and foster resiliency. Several studies evaluate its use in chronic illness, but also physician burnout. The goal is not to focus on relaxation, but rather on self-awareness, thus extending into a form of "reflective practice" (Epstein, JAMA 1999). This may translate into more effective clinical experiences and stress management skills. Method(s): This is a single-center, non-randomized pilot project to assess the feasibility and impact of a mindfulness-based wellness curriculum. All hematology oncology fellows at our institution are eligible for enrollment. A total of six monthly 30 minute sessions will be conducted within the framework of the existing didactic conferences. Each session is led by a social worker trained in mindfulness techniques. Participants will complete questionnaires pre- and post-intervention. Primary aim is feasibility determined through recruitment, participation, completion and compliance rates. This will also provide data for sample size estimation for a full-scale RCT. Secondary aim is acceptability, assessed using postintervention questions addressing usefulness of the program. Exploratory aim is to collect and examine data on self-reported stress and self-awareness - Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) (Carlson, 2005) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (Cohen, 1983). Enrollment began in December 2017 and 27 of 28 eligible participants have enrolled and completed pre-session questionnaires. One session has been conducted to date. To our knowledge, this is the first study assessing this type of intervention in this population.

N2  - Good resilience skills support effective and timely adjustment to demanding situations in the workplace. Existing tools are insufficient to develop and evaluate workplace interventions to improve employee's resilience skills. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a Resilience Skills Questionnaire (RSQ) using the key constructs of social cognitive theory - self-efficacy, self-regulation, and social support - as a theoretical framework. Following DeVellis' guidelines for scale development, first an expert panel of thirteen professors was recruited to support the item development stages and determine content validity. At this stage, the initial pool of 38 items was reduced to 25 items and CVR and CVI were calculated as 0.92 and 0.93, respectively, indicating good content validity. A second panel of ten health professionals confirmed face validity. An online survey comprised of the 25 developed items was then completed by 336 health professionals working in urban healthcare centers in Shiraz, Iran, in November 2021. The data were used to assess the psychometrics of the questionnaire according to its hypothesized three-dimensional structure. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded a final model of seventeen items in three dimensions, self-efficacy (six items), social support (six items), and self-regulation (five items), with good psychometric properties (chi2/df=2.44 (p<0.001), RMSEA=0.06, GFI=0.92, AGFI=0.90, IFI=0.93, CFI=0.93). All standardized factor loadings were significant (p<0.001). Internal consistency, as measured by Cronbach's alpha, was very good: RSQ (0.90), self-efficacy (0.86), social support (0.83), and self-regulation (0.86). Based on these results, the RSQ can be used as a standard and valid measure to develop and evaluate the effect of educational intervention programs to improve resilience skills and reduce job stress.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: What are fertility staff experiences of managing COVID-19-related uncertainty after fertility clinics re-opened? SUMMARY ANSWER: Staff identified many COVID-19-related uncertainty sources, the main being the COVID-19 health threat, to which most clinics and staff responded effectively by implementing safety protocols and building strong collaborative environments that facilitated the acquisition and application of information to guide organizational responses during a rapidly changing situation, but with costs for staff and patients. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: COVID-19 created significant disruption in fertility care delivery, including temporary clinic closure and treatment delay. Patients experienced significant distress, including concerns regarding the impact of COVID-19 and its vaccine on fertility and pregnancy. Multiple studies show that COVID-19-related uncertainty is a major threat and burden for healthcare staff, but this has not been investigated in reproductive medicine. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A cross-sectional, online mixed-method bilingual (English, Spanish) survey (active 25 January-23 May 2021) was distributed to fertility staff across the UK, Latin America, and Africa. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Eligibility criteria were being a healthcare worker at a fertility clinic that had re-opened since its COVID-19-related closure, 18years of age or older and ability to respond in English or Spanish. The survey was created in English, translated to Spanish, made available using Qualtrics, and consisted of four parts: (i) background and physical and mental wellbeing, (ii) open-ended questions regarding COVID-19 uncertainty, (iii) appraisal items regarding perceptions and impact of uncertainty, and (iv) changes in the workplace. The British Fertility Society and the African Network and Registry of Assisted Reproduction circulated the survey across the UK and Africa via email hyperlinks and social media platforms. The Argentinian Society of Reproductive Medicine and the Latin American Network of Assisted Reproduction distributed the survey across Latin America in the same manner. Thematic analysis was performed on responses from open-ended question to produce basic codes. Deductive coding grouped sub-themes across questions into themes related to the theory of uncertainty management. Descriptive statistics and repeated measures analysis of variance were used on the quantitative data. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In total, 382 staff consented to the survey, 107 did not complete (28% attrition), and 275 completed. Sixty-three percent were women, 69% were physicians, and 79% worked at private clinics. Thematic analysis produced 727 codes, organized in 92 sub-themes, and abstracted into 18 themes and one meta-theme reflecting that uncertainty is stressful but manageable. The types of uncertainties related to the threat of COVID-19 (20.6%), unpredictability of the future (19.5%), failure of communication (11.4%), and change in the workplace (8.4%). Staff appraisals of negative and positive impact of uncertainty were significantly lower (P<0.001) than appraisals of stress, controllability, and having what it takes to cope with uncertainty. To process uncertainty, clinics focused on information dissemination (30.8%) and building a collaborative work environment (5.8%), while staff employed proactive coping (41.8%) and emotional and cognitive processing (9.6%). Main organizational responses consisted on work restructuring (41.3%, e.g. safety protocols), adapting to adversity (9.5%, e.g. supplies, preparation), and welfare support (13.8%), though staff perceived lack of support (17.5%). Negative consequences of uncertainty were worse self- and patient welfare (12.1%) and worse communication due to virtual medicine and use of mask (9.6%). Positive consequences were work improvements (8.3%), organizational adaptation (8.3%), improved relationships (5.6%), and individual adaptation (3.2%). Ninety-two percent of participants thought changes experienced in the workplace due to COVID-19 were negative, 9.1% nor negative nor positive, and 14.9% positive. Most staff thought that their physical (92.4%) and mental health (89.5%) were good to excellent. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Participants were self-selected, and most were physicians and embryologists working at private clinics based in Latin America. The study did not account for how variability in national and regional COVID-19 policy shaped staff experiences of uncertainty. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: To address COVID-19 uncertainty, clinics need to promote collaborative (clinic, staff, patients) processing of uncertainty, clear team coordination and communication, organizational flexibility, and provision of support to staff and patients, with an emphasis on cognitive coping to decrease threat of and increase tolerance to uncertainty. Uncertainty management interventions bespoke to fertility care that integrate these components may increase clinics resilience to COVID-19-related and other types of uncertainty.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this project was to promote for the family caregivers of stroke patients the resilience evidence translation care model in the community. INTRODUCTION: Stroke is the main cause of disability among many patients with chronic diseases. Resilience helps family caregivers facing the consequences of adversity and stress to have a positive outcome. METHOD(S): The study utilized clinical audit strategies under the JBI Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System module. Three audit criteria for the caregivers of stroke patients were considered. A preimplementation audit was conducted with eight nurses and 30 caregivers to measure compliance between current practice and best practice. From that audit we identified barriers and facilitators to practice change by undertaking a Getting Research into Practice analysis. A postimplementation audit was conducted using the same number of samples at 8 weeks for the caregivers to evaluation, and the outcomes using follow-up audit. RESULT(S): The three criteria showed an improvement: nurses who received education about resilience care protocols, criterion 1 from 0 to 100%, criterion 2 from 0 to 100%, criterion 3 from 0 to 90%. The results showed that the average resilience of caregivers increased from 17.47 (SD +/- 1.94) to 18.33 (SD +/- 1.54). The resilience scale of pretest and posttest scores were significantly improved ( P  <= 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): The implementation of best practice for enhancing resilience of the family caregivers of stroke patients on the resilience evidence translation care model: a best practice implementation project in community settings is possible. The results indicate that evidence-based practice is an effective method for enhancing the resilience of family caregivers. The strategies contributed to the success of this project, such as scenario simulation education, Objective Structured Clinical Examination, regular weekly audits, and collaboration with project leaders when carrying out caregiver case discussion during clinical practice.Copyright Â© 2022 JBI.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Throughout and following the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak, there is an urgent need to focus on organizational support strategies aimed at improving the resilience of nurses. PURPOSE: This research aims to examine the relationship between the nurses' perceived organizational support and their resilience levels, and to reveal the characteristics that make a significant difference. METHOD(S): The data of this descriptive and cross-sectional study were collected from 722 nurses in February 2021 using the web-based survey method. The study followed the STROBE guideline. The data collection tools included the Introductory Information Form, the Survey of Perceived Organizational Support, and the Psychological Resilience Scale. RESULT(S): Nurses were concluded to have perceived a moderate level of organizational support and their psychological resilience were found to be higher than average. A positive relationship was determined between the organizational support perceived by nurses and their psychological resilience. The gender, position/title of nurses, their work experience in COVID-19 treatment services, and having been infected with the COVID-19 virus were found to affect their perception of organizational support and resilience. CONCLUSION(S): Organizational support perceived by nurses significantly affects their resilience. Resilience programs should, in particular, prioritize permanent clinical nurses who are in the risk group in terms of resilience, female nurses, nurses who had been infected with the COVID 19 virus, and nurses who have been assigned to COVID-19 treatment wards.

N2  - AIM: The principal aim of this study was to develop, pilot and evaluate an intervention intended to support the development of resilience and self-efficacy in parents of children with disabilities or complex health needs. BACKGROUND: Previous research has found that families often experience physical, social and emotional stress in the context of living with and caring for their disabled child. The literature indicates that a key factor in determining how well the parents of these children cope with their situation may be how resilient and self-efficacious they are. METHOD(S): A total of 16 parents of children with complex needs and disabilities were engaged in a series of guided conversations delivered during six contact visits with nurse co-researchers (community children's nurses who had received an intensive three-day preparation programme). The conversations, which were supported with additional material that was designed specifically for use in the study, were based around four key themes: emotional coping, practical coping, support networks and 'you and your child'. The impact of the intervention was evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative measures. FINDINGS: When interviewed, parents reported increased self-belief and self-confidence and indicated that they felt better supported and stronger as a result of the intervention. This was consistent with the quantitative evaluation which identified significant improvements on scores for active coping and self-blame on the brief COPE inventory scale and for empathy and understanding and self-acceptance on the TOPSE scale. Scores on the self-report distress thermometer demonstrated a significant reduction in self-reported distress scores at the end of the intervention period.

N2  - Background. Ongoing engagement in HIV care is crucial to optimizing outcomes while addressing changing needs. This project aimed to identify and address gaps in HIV education, counseling and engagement. Methods. Between 12/2021 and 5/2022, 20 education sessions for people with HIV (PWH) were held in 5 US HIV clinics as a 4-part series emphasizing (1) benefits of viral suppression, (2) talking about sexual health, (3) HIV treatment options, and (4) aging well with HIV. Surveys were administered to participating PWH and healthcare professionals (HCP). Content was extended for nationwide use through an online toolkit for HCPs, and a peer mentorship video for PWH. Results. Surveys were completed by 312 PWH and 68 HCPs who participated in the live sessions. At baseline, 32% of HCPs were confident in counseling PWH about improving ART switching and 41% about adherence, which improved to 47% (p< 0.001) and 55% (p< 0.001), respectively, after accessing the online toolkit. Most PWH demonstrated greater knowledge about "undetectable = untransmittable" (96%) and the need for ART for all PWH regardless of viral load (86%) after the sessions than before (69%; p< 0.05 and 46%; p< 0.05, respectively). Compared to baseline, more HCPs reported high confidence in counseling PWH about achieving and maintaining viral suppression (96% vs 64%; p< 0.05) after the sessions. While not meeting the level of statistical significance, some increases in HCP confidence were identified in counseling PWH about coping with mental health challenges (90% vs 69%; p=0.34), and managing HIV with comorbidities (80% vs 58%; p=0.41). When asked about medication adherence, HCPs commonly identified health insurance (55%) as a barrier, while most PWH reported no barriers (61%). All participants identified top goals. Most PWH indicated a goal to educate themselves about HIV treatment and prevention while HCPs prioritized education and conversations about sexual wellness. As of August 2022, the online toolkit extension was accessed by 3,320 HCPs, and the peer mentorship video by 4,331 PWH. Conclusion. PWH knowledge and HCP confidence in counseling PWH improved following live collaborative educational sessions. Post-program goals were aligned amongstPWH and providers who prioritized improving PWHunderstanding of HIV management.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Mental health professionals who work with clients exposed to trauma commonly experience secondary traumatic stress (STS) and burnout, which have a well-documented negative impact on clinicians as well as clients. As self-care has been identified as a protective factor against STS and burnout, the current study aimed to examine the effects of a self-care course for mental health professionals working with trauma-exposed clients. METHOD(S): This pretest-posttest pilot study examined the impact of a six-session virtual self-care course on the well-being of 43 mental health professionals previously trained in Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy(TF-CBT), a well-established, evidence-based treatment for childhood trauma. The components of TF-CBT comprise the acronym PRACTICE, and we are referring to this self-care course as PRACTICE Makes Progress (PMP), as participants receive weekly assignments that encourage the use of many of the same PRACTICE skills clients are taught in the context of TF-CBT. RESULT(S): Results comparing pre- and postcourse survey responses indicated significant increases in the use of PRACTICE skills (p = .006, d = .44) as well as the utilization of humor as a coping skill (p < .001, d = .53), and significant decreases in STS symptoms (p < .001, d = .63) and burnout (p = .004, d = .47). CONCLUSION(S): These results provide preliminary evidence that mental health professionals working with clients exposed to trauma may benefit from participation in an evidence-informed, standalone virtual self-care course.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted a huge emotional strain on mental health professionals (MHP) in Singapore. As Singapore transited into an endemic status, it is unclear whether the psychological strain has likewise lessened. The aims of this study were to investigate the levels of stress and burnout experienced by MHP working in a tertiary psychiatric hospital in Singapore during this phase of COVID-19 endemicity (2022) in comparison to the earlier pandemic years (2020 and 2021) and to identify factors which contribute to as well as ameliorate stress and burnout. A total of 282 MHP participated in an online survey in 2022, which included 2 validated measures, namely the Perceived Stress Scale and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI). Participants were also asked to rank factors that contributed the most to their stress and burnout. Between-group comparisons were conducted regarding stress and burnout levels among MHP across different demographic groupings and working contexts. In addition, OLBI data completed by MHP in 2020 and 2021 were extracted from 2 published studies, and trend analysis was conducted for the proportion of MHP meeting burnout threshold across 3 time points. We found that the proportion of MHP meeting burnout threshold in 2020, 2021 and 2022 were 76.9%, 87.6% and 77.9% respectively. Professional groups, age, years of experience and income groups were associated with stress and/or burnout. High clinical workload was ranked as the top factor that contributed to stress and burnout while flexible working arrangement was ranked as the top area for improvement so as to reduce stress and burnout. As such, policy makers and hospital management may want to focus on setting clear mental health targets and facilitate manageable clinical workload, build manpower resiliency, optimize resources and provide flexible work arrangements to alleviate stress and burnout among MHP.Copyright: Â© 2024 Yang et al.

N2  - Objectives: To explore the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of young people living in Trinidad and Tobago 011 matters affecting them during the pandemic. Method(s): Ten virtual focus groups were conducted with 64 participants aged 18 to 24 from June to August 2021. when partial lockdown measures were in effect for COV1D-19 prevention. Groups were stratified by geographic location and socioeconomic status. The recordings were transcribed and analysed to explore themes of importance to youth. Result(s): Negative impacts on mental health emerged as a strong theme. The lack of timelines for restrictions led to wide-ranging mental health impacts. Conflict and tension existed in home environments, longer restrictions led to the erosion of the social culture, and young people were stressed about the changing face of education and job security due to the pandemic. Conclusion(s): Measures taken to address COVID-19 led to the aggravation of mental health challenges among youth. Initiatives to help young people navigate their mental health issues must be developed. In low-resourced small island developing states, the increased need for mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for strengthening the capacity and resilience of these services in the event of environmental and health emergencies. Building the resilience of educational and employment services is needed.

N2  - Background: Military personnel who complete cognitive processing therapy (CPT) can still experience residual symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Gaining a deeper understanding of the characteristics that influence response to CPT may increase the likelihood of treatment success. Emotion regulation and trait resilience are associated with PTSD severity and may influence treatment response in active duty service members with PTSD. Method(s): This secondary analysis explored the association among reports of baseline emotion regulation (Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Short Form) and trait resilience (Response to Stressful Experiences Scale) with PTSD severity reductions in a sample of active duty service members (N = 268) who participated in a clinical trial that compared group-delivered and individual CPT. Population averaged models were utilized to examine if baseline predictors were related to change in PTSD severity from pre- to posttreatment. Result(s): Trait resilience predicted PTSD severity changes such that participants who reported less trait resilience at baseline demonstrated greater PTSD severity reductions over a course of CPT. There was also a main effect of adaptive emotion regulation on PTSD severity. Post-hoc correlation analyses revealed that baseline adaptive emotion regulation was positively associated with PTSD severity at pre- and posttreatment. Conclusion(s): Findings imply that service members with lower trait resilience may particularly benefit from CPT. Whether trait resilience moderates PTSD outcomes specific to CPT will require a trial with an alternative comparison treatment arm.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Background: Positive psychological interventions like self-efficacy, optimism, resilience, and patient well-being have a great influence on the clinically improved positive outcomes of medically ill individuals. In diabetic individuals, these positive psychological interventions have been linked with improved positive outcomes. In past decades, the importance of psychological support for diabetic individuals has been recognized and psychological counseling for such individuals has been recommended for improved positive outcomes in these individuals. Method(s): The current study aims to highlight the role of nurse in managing the impact of diabetes and the effect of psychological characteristics, including self-efficacy, resilience, optimism, and the well-being of diabetic patients on the positive outcomes. Research published in recognized journals published between 1970 and 2020 relating to diabetes, psychological nursing, self-efficacy, optimism, resilience, depression, anxiety, stress, and health outcomes were searched via search engines, including SciFinder, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, JSTOR, EBSCO, and PROTA. The study was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines and studies that did not link diabetes and psychological nursing with these issues or that lacked proper controls were excluded from the study. Result(s): Review of the articles indicated a significant degree of relation between psychological nursing and the physical and psychological well-being of diabetic patients. The psychological impact of diabetes, including anger, feeling loss, anxiety, and depression, are of great importance and can influence the disease state of diabetic patients. Psychotherapy assesses the patient to address the behavioral and emotional aspects of diabetes. Addressing the psychological impacts of diabetes plays a significant role in the treatment of diabetes, leading to better glycemic control. In diabetic patients, positive psychological characteristics are linked with fewer diabetic complications, reduced mortality and improved glycemic control. There are a number of ways in which a nurse can effectively manage complications associated with diabetes. Conclusion(s): Positive psychological interventions, self-efficacy, optimism, resilience, and the well-being of patients play significant roles in addressing the mental illnesses associated with diabetes and have shown improved positive outcomes in diabetic patients. Negative psychological characteristics like depression, anxiety, and stress are linked with poor health outcomes but can be effectively managed via psychological nursing.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Introduction: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with negative mental and physical health outcomes and predictive of higher sociodemographic risk. Introducing ACEs into undergraduate medical education is key to prevention, early recognition, and intervention. Method(s): In a 1-hour lecture, held live and viewed online, we delivered a condensed introduction to ACEs to first-year medical students. Live-classroom participants completed pre-/postsession questionnaires self-assessing their knowledge of 10 content areas on a 5-point Likert scale. We analyzed quantitative data to determine mean scores and differences. We synthesized qualitative data obtained from feedback. Result(s): One hundred twenty-four students, including 32 live-classroom attendees and 92 online viewers, participated in this activity. Self-assessment scores increased in all content areas measured, with a mean increase of 1.5 (p < .0001). The most significant increases occurred in identifying household dysfunction as ACEs (increase of 2.3), calculating an ACE score (increase of 2.2), differentiating between child abuse acts of commission and omission (increase of 1.9), describing resilience (increase of 1.7), and recognizing the link between ACEs and chronic medical conditions (increase of 1.4). Participants found the lecture informative, appreciating the use of the case illustrating how ACEs impact health and an interactive slide on the risks conferred by cumulative ACEs. Learners welcomed the positive message of resilience. Discussion(s): Introducing ACEs in medical student education is feasible. Educating the next generation of health providers on ACEs while highlighting prevention and resilience and teaching trauma-informed care is crucial. This lecture can be readily incorporated into medical student curricula.Copyright Â© 2020 Onigu-Otite and Idicula.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: In the new millennium, a growing focus on human rights and preserving individual autonomy urges the promotion of needs of the psychiatric patients. The topic of human needs takes its place also in patients with panic disorder. This review intended to explore current facts concerning the needs of the patients and present a broader understanding of patients' needs, due to the complexity of problems of patients with panic disorder. The text also focuses on psychosocial well-being and the quality of life of patients with panic disorder. METHOD(S): The PubMed was used to search for articles published between January 2000 and February 2020 using the following keywords: "panic disorder" or "agoraphobia" and "unmet needs" in combination with "pharmacotherapy" or "psychotherapy" or "cognitive behavioural therapy" or "family" or "quality of life." A total of 264 articles were selected by primary keyword picking in different combinations. Altogether 182 articles were reviewed. RESULT(S): We identified the most important unmet needs of patients with panic disorder connected to symptoms, treatment and help-seeking, stigma and self-stigma, family and quality of life. To help the patients to improve the unmet needs connected with: (1) symptoms is to increase the awareness of treatment steps for patients and their families, good cooperation with therapists, and management of persistent symptoms, alleviation or elimination of anxiety symptoms, avoidance and safety behaviour. (2) treatment is the quick approach, effective one, not too difficult, without side effects and harmless, not requiring hospitalization and not disturbing the daily routine, increasing treatment compliance, improving patient self-confidence and an active social network, affordable health and social services and more suitable information for families; (3) stigma is to change of public opinion about people with mental health problems and to create effective antistigma programs; (4) family is to include the support for a functional and independent life, helping to manage everyday tasks and stop excessive protection, while reducing the stigmatization of the whole family. (5) the quality of life is to help to integrate into the community and improve the factors that affect the quality of life; like esteem, self-acceptance, social acceptance etc. CONCLUSION(S): This review aimed to explore the unmet needs in patients with panic disorder or agoraphobia. In selected articles we identified 5 basic unmet needs and described the basic strategies to cope with them. It is essential for every clinician to understand those needs as it can substantially help to alleviate patients' symptoms and improve their quality of life. The importance of this understanding further highlights that unmet needs described for panic disorder overlap with unmet needs of other psychiatric disorder and thus have broader utility.

N2  - Background A hospice collaborative exists at the CEO level between Mountbatten, Oakhaven, and Rowans Hospices. Although historically staff joined hospices with palliative care experience, as vacancy levels have risen a more diverse workforce has been recruited with little or no palliative care experience. Our collaborative started to discuss the HEE Advanced Practice Framework, and how this relates to palliative and end of life care workforce development. Aims To harmonise staff development across the collaborative and establish uniform standards of palliative and end-of-life care. Ensuring staff moving across the hospices have the same level of proficiencies, building upon succession planning and a skilled workforce into the future with enhanced and advanced level skills. Method Competencies from across the collaborative of hospices were shared and then mapped against the NMC standards of proficiencies for Specialist Practitioner Qualifications. These were further mapped across the HEE framework of the four pillars of advanced practice enabling staff to review individual levels of proficiency achieved and focus their career aspirations. We have purposely called these proficiencies as they sit across Band 5-7 skills and apply to Allied health Professionals and Registered General Nurses equally. Results The number of staff now completing proficiencies up to non-medical prescribing has increased by 34%, supporting system pressures and resulting in better symptom control for patients delivered in their own homes by staff with enhanced skills to undertake this autonomous practice. Staff retention has also improved. Conclusion In the current financial climate access to clinical professional development funding for non-NHS staff is challenging. We have used our limited financial resource utilising the skills of the current specialist workforce to develop the enhanced skills needed for our clinicians new to palliative and end-of-life care. Building stronger resilient clinicians with the enhanced and advanced skills to deliver complex palliative and end-of-life care.

N2  - Background Clinical supervision has existed in healthcare since the 1990s but implementation has been inconsistent, with some believing it to be a management monitoring tool (Sloan, Watson. Nurs Standard. 2002;17(4):41-46; Nugent, Nanda, Hitchcock. BMJ Support Palliat Care. 2022;12:A3-A4). Recent data shows a high percentage (91%) of clinical hospice staff at our workplace have access to clinical supervision and it is valued highly, illustrated by its inclusion in local policies and induction procedures, as well as its inclusion in national policy. In 2021, we were invited to participate in a Hospice UK project to introduce Resilience Based Clinical Supervision (RBCS) to our hospice and this presentation describes our journey with implementing this model (Stacey, Cook, Aubeeluck, et al. Nurse Educ Today. 2020;94: 104564; Stacey, Aubeeluck, Cook, et al. Int Pract Develop J. 2017;7(2):5). Aims Our aim was to improve the experience of clinical supervision by increasing the tools and resources that supervisors could draw upon in their sessions. The particular components of the RBCS model would empower supervisees to build mindfulness techniques and reframing strategies, supporting their resilience and resulting in greater retention of skilled staff and a better quality of patient care. Methods Two clinical supervisors learned how to facilitate the RBCS model and cascaded this learning to two further supervisors. Following a pre-implementation baseline audit, the model is being trialled with selected small supervision groups who have consistent membership and regular attendance. After 6 sessions the group participants will be evaluated to assess the impact of the model. Results Supervisees' feedback is yet to be evaluated but supervisors report feeling empowered by having a structure to frame their sessions and are building confidence in the model. Conclusion After some initial supervisor resistance to the RBCS model, supervisees have responded very positively and this in turn has built confidence in supervisors. We plan to build our pool of RBCS trained supervisors so that as an organisation we have a wider range of strategies and tools to offer to our colleagues in clinical supervision.

N2  - Background Working in a hospice setting can be difficult and emotionally challenging (Goodrich, Harrison, Cornwall. Resilience: A framework supporting hospice staff to flourish in stressful times. Hospice UK, 2015). Caring for patients on a daily basis who are dying or nearing end of life can lead to emotional distress, burnout and a high turnover of staff (Fetter. Clin J Oncol Nurs. 2012; 16(6):559-561). Data shows that over 40% of hospice workers are either thinking about or actively planning on leaving their role (Royal College of Nursing. RCN Employment Survey 2021). St Gemma's Hospice currently offers individual supervision for all clinical staff, however, the uptake in some areas is poor. Aims We aim to relaunch clinical supervision (CS) which embeds both Restorative Clinical Supervision (RCS) and Resilience based clinical supervision models (RBCS) by: . Gaining an understanding of staff experience of supervision both as a supervisor and supervisee. . Revise and implement a CS model based on current best evidence. . Encourage staff to attend a minimum of quarterly. Method The hospice Clinical Supervision Leads successfully completed the Professional Nurse Advocate (PNA) course in 2022. This was developed around the A-Equip model (Macdonald. Bri J Midwifery. 2019;27(4): 258-264) which is a framework made of four distinct functions: Normative, formative, restorative and personal action for quality improvement. The model encourages staff to reflect on their own contribution to situations, building resilience which will empower them to make decisions independently. Training and supervisor support will integrate the new model into hospice provision using a flexible approach for staff to access either individual or group supervision. Proposed results/conclusion Staff to feel supported to make thoughtful, reflective decisions which will enhance their resilience to cope. This will in time, lead to less staff sickness and reduced staff burnout. We will measure the response to the new model by using 'check in' scales before and after the sessions to gauge effectiveness. Measurable outcomes of the project will include attendance, absence management, staff feedback and retention.

N2  - Background Community palliative care outside normal working hours is provided by both specialist palliative care professionals and primary/community health professionals. Understanding their experience of delivering care is important, not least in terms of impact on the quality of patient care (Maben, et al. Patients' experiences of care and the influence of staff motivation, affect and wellbeing. Final report. NIHR Service Delivery and Organisation programme; 2012). Aim To explore the experiences of professionals delivering community palliative care out-of-hours. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with professionals providing community palliative care, purposively sampled by discipline, specialist/primary, and model of care. Data analysis used reflexive thematic analysis. Results 28 interviews undertaken with 39 participants including specialist palliative care (n=21), primary/community care (n=15). Three main themes were: (1) staff distress, (2) overstretched resources (3) moral comfort. Most examples of distress were in the context of struggling with over-stretched and limited resources, and being unable to provide the care that aligned with their professional values. When expressing satisfaction that care had been provided well (moral comfort) it was in relation to going 'above and beyond', or where they had more control over time spent with patients, and could deliver the care needed. Discussion Professionals providing palliative care may have good strategies to deal with the distressing nature of their work, but organisational factors can increase distress (Goodrich, Harrison. Resilience: a framework enabling hospice staff to flourish in stressful times. Hospice UK, 2015), especially when resources (time, capacity, personnel) are insufficient. This constitutes 'moral distress' (being in a situation in which one is constrained from acting on what one knows to be right - Jameton. AMA J Ethics. 2017; 19(6): 617-628). Conclusion Most experiences of moral distress for professionals stemmed from insufficient healthcare resources to manage care needs at the end of life. This was most evident for district nursing services. Service leads and commissioners must listen carefully to experiences of professionals trying to provide high quality care, as well as patients and families.

N2  - Experiences of nonbinary psychotherapists have largely gone unexamined in the present literature. Using critical-constructivist grounded theory, we explored the experiences of 13 nonbinary licensed psychotherapists through qualitative semistructured interviews. Interviews were an average of 1.36 hr, and participants were recruited via social media and professional listservs. We found that nonbinary therapists ground their professional praxis-the embodiment of professional theory, action, and practice-in identity across four interconnected areas: navigating minority stress, disclosing identity, utilizing identity, and centering anti-oppression ideologies. Findings add to the nascent examination of experiences of marginalized mental health professionals and note the value of identity integration into professional work. For this population, identity is used in praxis, as it permeates their entire professional sphere. We highlight how these clinicians use their identity in challenging binary understandings of the therapeutic profession. Furthermore, nonbinary therapists demonstrate resilience among systems of oppression and are empowered when challenging binary ways of thinking with clients, supervisors, and peers. Our results indicate the importance of supporting and training nonbinary clinicians in how to use themselves and identity disclosures as effective therapeutic tools and how to manage minority stress and microaggressions that occur in their professional practice. It also underscores the general need for increased training targeted to educators and binary mental health professions aimed at increasing competence in working with nonbinary people.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Psychological distress after testing positive for human papillomavirus (HPV) at cervical cancer screening is well documented in the general population. However, little is known about the impact of an HPV-positive result on those with pre-existing mental health conditions, who may be at higher risk of experiencing clinically significant distress. This study explored the psychosocial impact of HPV in women with co-morbid mental health conditions, as well as their experience of cervical screening during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 22 women aged 27-54 who had tested positive for HPV at routine cervical screening in England, and who reported having at least one mental health condition. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULT(S): Being informed of an HPV-positive result increased distress and heightened pre-existing psychological challenges. Psychosocial response and duration of HPV-related distress appeared to be influenced by the ability to regulate emotions, number of consecutive HPV-positive results, interactions with health care professionals, and other life stressors. The experience added further complexity to many women's perceptions of self and self-esteem. Women who had received psychological treatment for their mental health condition were best able to self-manage HPV-related distress by applying learned coping skills. CONCLUSION(S): Receiving an HPV-positive result at cervical screening appears to be a distressing experience for women with co-morbid mental health conditions. Future hypothesis-driven research is needed to confirm findings and develop effective interventions to reduce psychosocial burden.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an enormous psychological impact worldwide. This study aimed to assess anxiety, depression, stress, and compensatory behaviors among Moroccan healthcare workers (HCWs) during COVID-19. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using a snowball sampling strategy. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using a snowball sampling strategy. Online surveys were sent to groups of HCWs working in Casablanca and Fez cities. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was measured using the Impact of Event Scale revised (IES-R) scale, and the DASS-21 was used to measure anxiety, depression, and stress among participants. Compensatory behaviors used by HCWs to manage these symptoms were also investigated. The majority of participants (72.5%) experienced moderate to severe distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of participants (53.1%) reported symptoms of mild to extremely severe depression. Overall, nurses, female, and frontline HCWs experienced more stress, anxiety, and depression (P<.001). Leisure activities (29%), sport (19%), and drinking tea/coffee (19%) were the most common compensatory behaviors. Our findings suggest that psychological support and interventions targeting high-risk HCWs with heavy psychological distress are needed. It is of paramount importance to improve the psychological endurance and safeguard the mental and physical well-being of HCWs, who find themselves on the frontline of health and humanitarian crises, when they are needed the most.

N2  - Caring for people with chronic kidney disease, let alone during a pandemic, can place nurses at risk for burnout. This study explored the effects of the Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) 8-week training on nephrology nurses' levels of self-compassion, burnout, and resilience. Twelve nurses participated. Surveys were completed before, immediately after, and three months after training. A focus group was also conducted. Results demonstrated in creased levels of self-compassion, mindfulness, and resilience while levels of burnout decreased. The central qualitative theme was enhanced resilience. Subthemes were creating a community of support, awareness and discovery, and the mastery of the techniques. The MSC training was an effective intervention to build essential skills for maintaining a healthy workforce. Implementation of such training programs within the health care environment are highly encouraged.CopyrightÂ© by the American Nephrology Nurses Association.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the scope and severity of the second victim problem among nurses by examining the experiences and effects of patient safety incidents (PSIs) on them. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: 492 nurses who had experienced PSIs and provide direct care in South Korean medical institutions. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study with anonymous online self-report questionnaires was conducted to nurses in order to examine the experiences and effects of PSIs. Scales measuring post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and post-traumatic embitterment disorder (PTED) were used for a more quantitative examination of the effects of PSIs. A chi2 test was administered to find any difference in responses to difficulties due to PSIs between the direct and indirect experience of PSIs. Furthermore, linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the factors related to scores on the PTSD and PTED scales. RESULT(S): A statistically significant difference was observed for participants who reported having experienced sleeping disorders, with those with direct experience showing 42.4% sleeping disorders and indirect experience at 21.0%. Also, there was a statistically significant difference between the 34.3% with direct experience and the 22.1% with indirect experience regarding having considered duty or job changes (resignation). Regression analysis showed total PTSD scores for indirect experience at 11.97 points (95% CI: -17.31 to -6.63), lower than direct experience. Moreover, those who thought the medical error was not involved in PSI had a total PTED score 4.39 points (95% CI: -7.23 to -1.55) lower than those who thought it was involved. CONCLUSION(S): A considerable number of nurses experienced psychological difficulties due to PSIs at levels that could interfere with their work. The effect of PSIs on nurses with direct experience of PSIs was greater compared with those with indirect experience. There need to be psychological support programmes for nurses to alleviate the negative effects of PSIs.Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Objective 1: To determine if it is feasible to conduct an RCT of online Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff under the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and need for remote trial monitoring. Objective 2: To assess whether online versions of SKY and/or Health Enhancement Program (HEP) result in improvement in self-rated measures of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and resilience. TRIAL DESIGN: This is an open-label feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing an online breath based yogic intervention SKY versus an online control mind-body intervention HEP in frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Participants will include frontline hospital and long-term care home staff that are involved in the management of COVID-19 patients in London, Ontario, Canada. Participants will be willing and able to attend via online video conferencing software to participate in the study interventions. Participants must have an adequate understanding of English and be able to sit without physical discomfort for 60 minutes. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY): The online version of SKY will be delivered by at least one certified Canadian SKY teacher, with at least one back up teacher at all times, under the supervision of Ms. Ronnie Newman, Director of Research and Health Promotion, Art of Living Foundation, USA. The online version of SKY for healthcare workers has a total duration of 3 hours. Phase I will consist of 5 self-paced online modules of 4-10 minutes each to learn the breath control techniques. Participants will be sent an online survey in REDCap requesting that they self-confirm completion of the Phase I modules. In Phase II, 2 interactive online sessions of 1 hour each will be held on consecutive days with a certified SKY teacher, during which participants will learn the fast, medium and slow breaths. For ease of scheduling, multiple time windows will be offered for Phase II. There will be at least one back up teacher at all times. Both Phase I and II will be completed in the first week. Health Enhancement Program (HEP): The active control arm, HEP, will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules for Phase I. Phase II will consist of mindfulness-based meditation sessions delivered by mental health staff. HEP will be an active treatment program that incorporates mind-body interventions. HEP will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules with psychoeducation on healthy active living as well as interactive modules comprising of guided de-stressing exercises including music therapy, mindfulness and progressive muscle relaxation. Weekly follow up sessions will be offered to all recruited participants for 30 minutes each for the subsequent 4 weeks in both study arms. MAIN OUTCOMES: The following feasibility outcomes will be measured at the end of the study: (1) rate of participant recruitment, (2) rate of retention, (3) completeness of data entry, (4) cost of interventions, and (5) unexpected costs. Such measures will be collected on a daily basis through-out the study and tabulated 5 weeks later at the end of the study. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be randomized after they have electronically signed the consent form and the research staff have confirmed eligibility. We will use REDCap to perform randomization in a 1:1 ratio as well as allocation concealment. REDCap is widely used by health researchers worldwide to significantly reduce data entry and study management errors to improve data fidelity. BLINDING (MASKING): All study participants will be blinded to the study hypotheses so as to prevent any expectation bias. Group allocation will be masked during analysis. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): This study will randomize a total of 60 participants in a 1:1 ratio to either SKY or HEP interventions. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version number 2.0 (June 5, 2020). Recruitment is currently ongoing (starting June 25, 2020). We anticipate to complete recruitment by June 30, 2021 and complete the study by September 30, 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov protocol ID NCT04368676 (posted April 30, 2020). FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

T1  - Resilience and Suicide in Special Operations Forces: State of the Science via Integrative Review

N2  - BACKGROUND: Due to alarming rates of suicide in Special Operations Forces (SOF) and associated effects of traumatic stress in military populations writ large, resilience initiatives thought to influence Servicemembers' mitigation of traumatic stress and thus lower suicide risks have been implemented throughout the services. Since combat operations commenced in multiple theaters of war nearly two decades ago, resilience in conventional military populations became a topic of keen interest throughout departments of defense worldwide as well. Despite researchers' consistent assertions that SOF are highly resilient and at low risk for suicide, granular analysis of pertinent research and escalating suicide in SOF reveals no empirical basis for those beliefs. METHOD(S): We report findings from an integrative review of resilience research in SOF and larger military populations to contextualize and augment understanding of the phenomenon. RESULT(S): Throughout the literature, conceptual and operational definitions of resilience varied based on country, context, investigators, and military populations studied. We identified critical gaps in resilience knowledge in the military, specifically: Resilience has not been studied in SOF; resilience is not concretely established to reduce suicide risk or proven to improve mental health outcomes; resilience differs when applied as a psychological construct; resilience research is based on specific assumptions of what composes resilience, depending on methods of measurement; resilience studies in this population lack rigor; research methodologies and conflicting interests invite potential bias. CONCLUSION(S): This integrative review highlights emergent issues and repetitive themes throughout military resilience research: resilience program inefficacy, potential investigator bias, perpetuated assumptions, and failure to capture and appropriately analyze germane data. Because of overall inconsistency in military resilience research, studies have limited external validity, and cannot be applied beyond sampled populations. Resilience cannot be responsibly offered as a solution to mitigating posttraumatic stress disorder nor suicide without detailed study of both in SOF.Copyright 2019.

T1  - Hospital emergency management: A programing and profession assessment
A1  - Campbell J.G. 
Y1  - 2019//
N2  - At a national and international level, governments have advanced all-hazards readiness and implemented disaster management systems within multiple industries, services, and sectors. This scope included public health agencies and healthcare providers, whose roles evolved in purpose and expectation within their respective communities, but their core mission remained unchanged. Real-world emergencies and disasters routinely challenge hospitals and affirm that healthcare providers must be prepared to provide, sustain, and expand critical services during times of crisis. This study reviews emergency management (EM) and disaster preparedness programing specifically within hospitals and healthcare systems to assess overall effectiveness. Analysis includes a review of existing program administration literature and regulatory and accreditation agency standards. Initial findings suggest ongoing efforts are needed nationwide to improve hospital EM capabilities and enhance the resiliency of American healthcare infrastructure. Identified gaps include limitations of pertinent research, inconsistent program evaluation metrics and processes, and hindering perceptions of profession role and purpose. Recommendations are provided to refine the traditional hospital EM profession and advance overall program administration competencies, as well as considerations for future research opportunities.

T1  - Developing resilience: the role of nurses, healthcare teams and organisations
A1  - Barratt C. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Discussions about the sustainability of the healthcare workforce have placed considerable emphasis on improving the resilience of healthcare professionals. However, when discussed in relation to individuals, the contextual aspects of resilience are often lost. This means that individuals are burdened with the responsibility of increasing their resilience so that they can better manage the challenges they experience, rather than examining the external and environmental factors that can affect resilience. This article explores the concept of resilience and suggests ways in which resilience can be developed by individuals and in collaboration with others, resulting in resilient healthcare teams and organisations capable of supporting individuals effectively. It aims to assist healthcare professionals to develop their resilience, while also improving their understanding of the complex factors that can affect their coping capacity, as well as how community influences the resilience of everyone.Copyright Â© 2018 RCN Publishing Company Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers of cancer patients often experience high levels of stress and burden, leading to the adoption of ineffective coping strategies. This can result in psychological problems for the caregivers and inadequate care provision. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to investigate the impact of Benson's relaxation technique (BRT) on coping strategies among informal caregivers of cancer patients. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: This open-label randomized clinical trial enrolled 113 caregivers visiting the radiotherapy and chemotherapy departments of Vasei Hospital in Sabzevar, Iran, who scored >=48 on the Novak and Guest Caregiver Burden Inventory. The participants were randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group received BRT, with participants performing the technique twice a day for 20 minutes each time over a 1-month period. The control group did not receive any intervention. Coping strategies were assessed using Endler and Parker's coping strategies inventory. RESULT(S): The findings of the study revealed that the intervention group showed an increase in the utilization of problem-oriented coping strategies (P = .076) and a decrease in the utilization of emotion-oriented coping strategies (P < .001) and avoidance-oriented coping strategies in the intervention group compared with the control group (P = .004). CONCLUSION(S): Findings suggest that BRT, as a cost-effective and nonpharmacological intervention, effectively reduces the reliance on emotion-oriented and avoidance-oriented coping strategies among informal caregivers of cancer patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Healthcare professionals working in oncology settings are encouraged to incorporate BRT into their care practices.Copyright Â© 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Summary. Aim. The Covid-19 pandemic is having a great impact on the lives of healthcare workers, but its psychological impact on Mental Healthcare Workers (MHWs) remains to be better explored. The aims of the present study were to assess the correlates and predictors of stress and adverse psychological effects in MHWs during the first waves of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods. A total of 124 MHWs (psychiatrist/psychiatry resident, nurse, psychologist/psychotherapist, psychiatric rehabilitation therapist/educator, other mental health professional) working in public facilities of the ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia, Italy, was assessed between June 28, 2020 and August 10, 2020 with an online questionnaire that included sociodemographic, professional and Covid-19 exposure information, the Impact of Event Scale - Revised and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21. Multivariate linear regression models were designed to identify individual predictors of post-traumatic, depressive, anxiety and stress-symptoms. Results. The professional role of nurse, having more years of professional experience and experiencing the death of a patient emerged as predictors of more severe post-traumatic symptoms. The professional role of nurse emerged as the only predictor of more severe depressive symptoms; the professional role of nurse and having more years of professional experience emerged as predictors of more severe anxiety symptoms; more years of professional experience, higher workloads, worse team relationships and experiencing the death of a loved one emerged as predictors of more severe stress symptoms. Conclusions. Alongside other stressful factors, the professional role of nurse and more years of professional experience emerged as predictors of adverse psychological events. Working as a MHW, particularly with high levels of contact with patients during the Covid-19 pandemic, may be considered strenuous work, requiring dedicated training and interventions to improve resilience.Copyright Â© 2023 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l..

N2  - Introduction Chronic nightmares are a common and disabling feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for which broadly effective treatments are still lacking. While imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT) demonstrates benefits for patients with idiopathic nightmares and some patients with PTSD-related nightmares, research indicates it may be less beneficial for veterans. Narrative therapy (NT) is a form of psychotherapy which is client-centered and value-focused and has demonstrated benefits for PTSD patients. The application of NT principles to IRT may provide a valuable therapeutic approach for treatment in veterans. Objective To perform a retrospective chart review of veteran clients participating in a novel, brief intervention developed by the first author consisting of IRT enhanced with NT principles (N-IRT) for the treatment of nightmares. The primary outcomes were nightmare frequency and intensity, and the secondary outcome was the impact of the intervention on nightmare distress and coping, subjective sleep quality, and overall PTSD symptoms. Materials and Methods We conducted retrospective chart reviews for eight veterans referred to the first author for the treatment of nightmares, who completed N-IRT, including baseline and end-of-treatment measures. The protocol involved a single 60-minute NT-enhanced rescripting session and assigned homework to rehearse the revised dream script, and a follow-up evaluation 4 weeks later. The subjects completed a sleep and nightmare interview developed by the first author and the PTSD Checklist at baseline and after the intervention at the follow-up evaluation. Paired t-tests were conducted to test for pre-to-post differences. Results In the statistical analysis, we observed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the frequency (p 1/4 0.04) and intensity of nightmares (p 1/4 0.001) from pretreatment to the 1-month follow-up. Measures of nightmare-associated emotional distress, the ability to cope with nightmares, sleep duration and sleep efficiency, as well as overall PTSD symptoms also demonstrated significant improvements. Conclusion These pilot data provide compelling preliminary evidence that a single-session IRT intervention modified with NT (N-IRT) is effective in reducing nightmare frequency and intensity, reducing nightmare distress, improving the act of coping with nightmares, and improving sleep quality and overall PTSD symptoms in veterans. Further investigation of this method with gold-standard clinical trial designs and larger sample sizes is indicated to confirm effectiveness and to better understand the possible mechanisms of treatment effect.Copyright Â© 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nurses play an essential role in responding to severe viral disease which bring considerable challenges to their personal and professional well-being. This subsequently can affect the delivery of care and healthcare systems' organisational capacity to respond. Understanding nurses' experiences of these challenges will help inform healthcare policies. AIM: To explore the experiences and coping strategies of nurses caring for patients during severe viral disease pandemics. DESIGN: A mixed-methods systematic review informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology. METHOD(S): A mixed-methods systematic review. Five electronic databases Medline, CINAHL, PsychInfo, ASSIA and Scopus were searched on 4th April 2021. Results were reported in accordance with PRISMA. The findings were analysed and reported in the context of the Self-Regulatory Common-Sense Model. RESULT(S): In total, 71 peer-review primary research articles describing nurses' experiences of caring for patients during SARS, MERS, Swine flu H1N1, Avian influenza or SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 published in English from 2003 to 2021 were included. We found links between nurses' perception of the health threats, their emotional reactions, and coping strategies. Perceived health threats were influenced by organisational factors including frequent changes in clinical guidelines and workplace protocols, onerous workloads and working hours, unavailability of PPE, and lack of knowledge and training in pandemic management. These impacted nurses' physical, psychological and social well-being. Nurses also reported helpful and unhelpful coping strategies to manage the health threats. CONCLUSION(S): It is vital for stakeholders, policymakers, government and healthcare institutions to recognise and monitor the wider impact on healthcare workers from health emergencies. In addition, support to develop and implement effective systems and individual mechanisms to offset the anticipated impact pre and post pandemics/epidemics is needed. Our findings can inform those strategies for similar future health emergencies. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses are often the first point of contact in providing direct care to patients, hence they are at high risk of being infected. The findings from this review can help managers and policymakers in developing programmes to enhance resilience in the nursing workforce. NO PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This was a literature review study.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Clinical Nursing published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - AIM: To explore the International Network for Child and Family Centred Care (INCFCC) members' experiences and views on the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the nursing workforce. BACKGROUND: On the 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. While some countries adopted a herd immunity approach, others imposed stricter measures to reduce the transmission of the virus. Hospitals in some countries faced an avalanche of extremely sick admissions, whereas others experienced an early surge in cases or were able to control the spread. DESIGN: Discursive paper. METHOD(S): A web-based survey was e-mailed to 63 INCFCC members from 28 March to 30 April 2022, as an invitation to share their experience concerning the long-term impact of COVID-19 on their role as a nurse educator, clinician or researcher. RESULT(S): Sixteen members responded, and the responses were grouped under the themes stress and anxiety, safe staffing and pay, doing things differently, impact on research, impact on teaching and learning, impact on clinical practice, nursing made visible and lessons for the future. CONCLUSION(S): The INCFCC members provided their views and highlighted the impact on their role in nursing education, administration, research and/or practice. This discussion of international perspectives on the similarities and differences imposed by COVID-19 found that the impact was wide-ranging and prolonged. The overarching theme revealed the resilience of the participating members in the face of COVID-19. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study highlights the importance of all areas of nursing, be it in academia or in clinical practice, to work together to learn from the present and to plan for the future. Future work should focus on supporting organizational and personal resiliency and effective interventions to support the nursing workforce both during a disaster and in the recovery phase.

N2  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of nursing students in England who had worked through the first wave and transitioned to qualification in the ongoing pandemic. BACKGROUND: Experiences of health professionals and student nurses during the pandemic are now well documented, but the transition of students to qualification is less well understood. In Summer 2020, we interviewed 16 student nurses who had worked as health care assistants on paid extended placements as part of the COVID-19 response in the East of England, finding surprisingly positive experiences, including perceived heightened preparedness for qualification. A year later, we re-interviewed 12 participants from the original study to hear about transitioning to qualification during the ongoing pandemic. This study provides novel insights into their experiences. DESIGN: A qualitative study design was used. METHOD(S): Twelve newly qualified nurses who had participated in the original study took part in qualitative, online interviews where they shared their experiences of working and transitioning to qualification during the ongoing pandemic since we spoke to them a year earlier. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. COREQ guidelines were used in developing and reporting this study. RESULT(S): Three themes were identified. Constant change: in the clinical environment and arising out of the transition to newly qualified nurse, mental health and well-being and reflecting on the past to learn for the future. CONCLUSION(S): Participants experienced a unique transition to qualification. The perceived heightened preparedness for qualification that participants who had worked as students during the first wave of the pandemic had become a reality, ameliorating some of the known effects of transition. However, increased expectations and added responsibilities in extremely busy, fluctuating clinical environments with minimal support add weight to calls for mandatory preceptorship programmes. While heightened resilience was evident, provision of ongoing mental health and well-being support is strongly recommended. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: We need a partnership approach with nurse educators and practice colleagues which ensures preparation for qualified practice is appropriate. If we do not effectively prepare students for qualified nurse posts, patient care will almost certainly be compromised.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors.

N2  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This review aims to synthesize the available evidence of what patients experience when infected with COVID-19, both in hospital and post-discharge settings. DESIGN: This review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for qualitative systematic reviews and evidence synthesis. Reporting of results was presented according to the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) checklist. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a public health crisis worldwide. Many patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have varied levels of persisting mental disorders. Previous studies have reported the degree, prevalence and outcome of psychological problems. Minimal research explored the experience of patients with long COVID. The real-life experience of patients with COVID-19 from diagnosis to post-discharge can deepen the understanding of nurses, physicians and policymakers. METHOD(S): All studies describing the experience of patients were included. Two authors independently appraised the methodological quality of the included studies using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research 2020. RESULT(S): This systematic review aggregated patients' experience of being diagnosed with COVID-19 in both hospitalized and post-discharge settings. Finally, 17 studies met inclusion criteria and quality appraisal guidelines. The selected studies in the meta-synthesis resulted in 12 categories, and further were concluded as five synthesized findings: physical symptoms caused by the virus, positive and negative emotional responses to the virus, positive coping strategies as facilitators of epidemic prevention and control, negative coping strategies as obstacles of epidemic prevention and control, and unmet needs for medical resource. CONCLUSION(S): The psychological burden of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is heavy and persistent. Social support is essential in the control and prevention of the epidemic. Nurses and other staff should pay more attention to the mental health of the infected patients both in and after hospitalization. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses should care about the persistent mental trauma of COVID-19 survivors and provide appropriate psychological interventions to mitigate the negative psychological consequences of them. Besides, nurses, as healthcare professionals who may have the most touch with patients, should evaluate the level of social support and deploy it for them. It is also needed for nurses to listen to patient's needs and treat them with carefulness and adequate patience in order to decrease the unmet needs of patients.Copyright Â© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Imposter Phenomenon (IP) is a subjective feeling of intellectual fraudulence and self-doubt experienced by individuals in goal-orientated high-achieving professions. The impact of IP within healthcare has been associated with individual physical and mental health and concerns around training, career progression and DEI at an institutional level. To effectively address IP in healthcare, this scoping review aims to explore educational interventions designed to empower high-achieving individuals with the tools needed to confront and overcome IP. METHOD(S): The scoping review adhered to a predetermined protocol informed by the JBI methodology and PRISMA-ScR guidelines in order to identify educational interventions addressing IP in high-achieving industries. Articles were searched across multiple databases, including MEDLINE (Ovid), PsychINFO, SCOPUS, and Web of Science, alongside grey literature, without imposing any time constraints. A systematic approach including a thematic analysis allowed for a nuanced exploration and interpretation of the identified educational interventions and their impact on addressing IP. RESULT(S): Seventeen articles were incorporated into the review, with the majority originating from the USA and majority being published since 2020. Ten studies targeted healthcare professionals, undergraduate and postgraduate healthcare students. Majority of studies aimed at addressing IP, featured a larger number of female participants than males. Workshops with self-reflection and group-guided exercises to overcome IP were the most popular educational interventions. Coaching and structured supervision were also suggested. Across all papers, three themes emerged for coping strategies: individual, peer-to-peer, and institutional. CONCLUSION(S): This scoping review suggests how group and individual interventions such as workshops, small group discussions and coaching can be used to overcome IP in healthcare. Institutional changes like diversity promotion, supervisor education, and support networks are crucial in addressing IP. Further long term and speciality specific assessments are needed to measure impact. Overall, the review highlights how educational awareness and a variety of strategies can be implemented to create a supportive environment for professionals dealing with IP, promoting their well-being and success.Copyright Â© 2023.

N2  - The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as the ACA, was legislation passed in the United States in 2010 to expand access to health insurance coverage for millions of Americans with a key emphasis on preventive care. Nutrition plays a critical role in overall wellness, disease prevention and resilience to chronic illness but prior to the ACA many Americans did not have adequate health insurance coverage to ensure proper nutrition. With passage of the ACA, more individuals received access to nutritional counseling through their primary care physicians as well as prescription vitamins and supplements free of charge. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a national health insurance reform on nutrient intake among general population, including more vulnerable low-income individuals and patients with chronic conditions. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we identified 8,443 adults aged 21years and older who participated in the survey before (2011-2012) and after the ACA (2015-2016) implementation and conducted a subgroup analysis of 952 respondents who identified as Medicaid beneficiaries and 719 patients with a history of cancer. Using pre-post study design and bivariate and multivariable logistic analyses, we compared nutrient intake from food and supplementation before and after the ACA and identified risk factors for inadequate intake. Our results suggest that intake of micronutrients found in nutrient-dense foods, mainly fruit and vegetables, has not changed significantly after the ACA. However, overall use of nutritional supplements increased after the ACA (p =0.05), particularly magnesium (OR=1.02), potassium (OR=0.76), vitamin D (both D2, and D3, OR=1.34), vitamin K (OR=1.15) and zinc (OR=0.83), for the general population as well as those in our subgroup analysis Cancer Survivors and Medicaid Recipients. Given the association of increased use of nutritional supplements and expansion of insurance access, particularly in our subgroup analysis, more research is necessary to understand the effect of increasing access to nutritional supplements on the overall intake of micro- and macronutrients to meet daily nutritional recommended allowances.Copyright Â© 2023 Kirk, Tufuor, Shaver, Nie, Devarshi, Marshall, Mitmesser and Noyes.

N2  - Recent research in the fields of women's health, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease presents new opportunities for countering risk and supporting resilience in women's cognitive aging. Women represent two-thirds of individuals currently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and this disparity is impacted by factors related to both biological sex and the social construct of gender. Some sex-based risks to women are unchangeable, such as women's up to 4 times greater dementia risk due to having copies of the apolipoprotein epsilon 4 allele (ApoE E4). At the same time, other sex- and genderinfluenced risks are treatable or amenable to change. For example, women are twice as likely as men to be physically inactive and at twice the risk for depression, both of which are malleable risks for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Women also experience greater brain-based impact of several avoidable or treatable chronic diseases, including sleep apnea and diabetes. Another area of interest is stress effects on sex-based dementia risk. Women have greater odds of experiencing certain kinds of stressors and show sex-specific short and long-term stress responses in the brain and periphery, which in turn may have detrimental effects on memory system function and structure. Beyond these factors, menopause represents a sex-specific dementia risk factor of high current interest. Estrogen directly supports memory and neural plasticity in memory systems. Both monthly fluctuations in estrogen across the menstrual cycle and loss of estrogen at menopause have been associated with measurable changes in brain activity, brain microand macro-structure, and memory performance on standardized tests. Some women's brains may recover poorly from the typical menopause transition, placing them at greater dementia risk. In addition, early and surgical menopause present risk for poor cognitive aging. Despite the daunting nature of women's added dementia risk, understanding these sex-and gender-based risks more deeply can help direct interventions for women's resilience in cognitive aging. This is key, as research shows up to 40% of current cases of dementia and Alzheimer's disease may have been avoided with changes to lifestyle, beginning in early adulthood and continuing throughout the lifespan. To date, evidence points toward critical preventive roles for exercise, stress management, and treating or helping women to avoid risks such as smoking, heavy drinking, diabetes, hypertension, and depression. Intellectual and social engagement have also shown important roles in resilience. Mechanistic and intervention work on these resilience-supporting behaviors is ongoing, and the potentially brain-health supporting role of menopausal hormone therapy remains under investigation. Given the complex and challenging nature of changing lifestyle, support for women's healthy aging requires an early, partnership-based approach, one that appreciates the intersection of sex- and gender-based risks with those risks related to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Women's health providers have unique opportunities to support resilience through educating patients about protecting their brain health through the life span. Taking this proactive approach may significantly reduce the future public health burden of dementia.

N2  - In 2015, >50 million cubic meters of Fe mining tailings were released into the Doce River basin from the Fundao dam, raising the question of its consequences on the affected ecosystems. This study aimed to establish a mineralogical-(geo)chemical association of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) from Fe mining tailings from the Fundao dam, collected seven days after the failure, through a multidisciplinary approach combining assessment of the risk to human health, environmental geochemistry, and mineralogy. Thus, eleven tailings samples were collected with the support of the Brazilian Military Police Fire Department. Granulometry, magnetic measurements, optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and sequential chemical extraction of PTEs analyses were performed. Contamination indexes, assessment of risk to human health, and Pearson correlation were calculated using the results of sequential chemical extraction of PTEs. The predominance of goethite in Fe oxyhydroxide concentrates from the mud indicates that the major source of hematite may not be from tailings, but from pre-existing soils and sediments, and/or preferential dissolution of hematite in deep flooded zones of the tailings column of the Fundao dam. Moreover, the high correlation of most carcinogenic PTEs with their crystallographic variables indicates that goethite is the primary source of contaminants. Goethites from Fe mining tailings showed high specific surface area and Al-substitution, and due to their greater stability and reactivity, the impacts on PTE sorption phenomena and bioavailability may be maintained for long periods. However, their lower dissolution rate, and the consequent release of heavy metals would promote greater resilience for affected ecosystems, preventing significant PTE inputs under periodic reduction conditions. More specific studies, involving the crystallographic characteristics of Fe oxyhydroxides should be developed since they may provide another critical component of this set of complex and dynamic variables that interfere with the bioavailability of metals in ecosystems.Copyright Â© 2023

N2  - Mental health nursing is a privilege and a rewarding profession. There has been a call for transformational change in mental health services to improve outcomes for the people of New Zealand, with mental health nurses integral to this. However, with predicted nursing shortages, high levels of burnout, and increasing demands in the workplace, an organizational focus on wellbeing for mental health nurses is needed to sustain the workforce, implement change and improve outcomes for people using mental health services. An integrative review of the literature was undertaken to explore how organizations can optimize mental health nurses' wellbeing in the workplace and to identify measures for organizations to support mental health nurses' wellbeing with a focus on New Zealand. Seven articles were included in this review after a search, data extraction and evaluation. Data were synthesized and categorized using thematic analysis. The findings indicate organizations can invest in several initiatives to enhance mental health nurses' wellbeing in the workplace. These include professional development, skills to build resilience, enabling time to reflect on practice, enhancing professional supervision, having the right managerial support and focusing on individual's strengths. Organizations need to prioritize mental health nurses' wellbeing by embedding the practical strategies this review identified and by addressing organizational barriers to wellbeing. Organizations should consider implementing multileveled organizational wellbeing initiatives to nurture and grow the New Zealand mental health nursing workforce which in turn will contribute to quality care and enable mental health nurses to have long meaningful careers. Time, investment and resources are essential for these initiatives to be effective.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors.
