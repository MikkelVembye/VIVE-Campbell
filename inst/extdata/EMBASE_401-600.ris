N2  - AIMS: To investigate the level of spiritual health in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from the core dimensions and to explore its associated factors. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHOD(S): Participants were recruited from four hospitals between September 2020 and June 2021, using a convenience sampling. Older patients with COPD (n=162) completed the demographic and disease-related information questionnaires, Function Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Spiritual Scale, 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, General Self-efficacy Scale, Social Support Rating Scale, COPD Assessment Test, 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale and modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale. Descriptive statistics, Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses, t-tests, one-way ANOVA and multiple linear regression models were used. RESULT(S): Older patients with COPD have a moderate level of spiritual health. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that psychological resilience, general self-efficacy, social support, symptom burden and monthly income were associated with the core dimensions of spiritual health. CONCLUSION(S): Chinese older patients with COPD have a moderate level of spiritual health. Psychological resilience, general self-efficacy, social support, monthly income and symptom burden were associated with the core dimensions of spiritual health. IMPACT: This study is the first to investigate the level of spiritual health in older patients with COPD from the core dimensions and to explore its associated factors, providing a basis for developing spiritual intervention programs. Our findings can help us realize that intervention strategies of psychological resilience, general self-efficacy and social support can all be used to enhance spiritual health. Nurses should focus on the spiritual health of older COPD patients with high symptom burden and low monthly income. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Although we did not directly involve patients and the public because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of the study will be disseminated to patients and the public through WeChat and seminars.Copyright © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - AIM: To describe experiences of work-related stress, stress reactions and coping strategies among registered nurses (RNs) in the ambulance service (AS). DESIGN: A descriptive and qualitative design. METHOD(S): Participants were recruited from eight different ambulance stations from different geographical locations in central Sweden. Data were collected from 14 RNs during the period from January 2022 to May 2022 using a semi-structured interview guide. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse data using an abductive approach. RESULT(S): Three categories describe the RNs' experiences; (1) Situations that cause work-related stress, (2) Reactions and feelings that occur and (3) Management of work-related stress. These three main categories included a total of 12 subcategories. Work-related stress was experienced when participants were a part of traumatic events or experienced insufficient cooperation or a disturbing event in the work environment. The different causes lead to different kinds of reactions with feelings of frustration, fear and loneliness being prominent. To manage the work-related stress, RNs used different kinds of strategies and support from colleagues or lack thereof seemed to have a major impact. CONCLUSION(S): Findings revealed the importance of having competent colleagues in the AS. Working with a competent colleague can reduce experiences of stress and prevent feelings of loneliness. It is important for the AS to provide stress-reduction support, to promote cooperation and to maintain and develop RNs' professional competence to ensure quality care and patient safety in the AS.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of the study is to examine what kind of changes the operation has brought about in the social and psychological life of women. Method(s): The study was a hermeneutic-phenomenological research conducted using qualitative research methods. It took place between May and July 2023 at a university hospital located in Istanbul, Turkey. Following ethical approval, the study included a total of 24 women who had undergone a 'total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.' These participants were selected using a combination of maximum diversity sampling and random sampling methods. Data collection was carried out using a semi-structured interview form. The interviews were conducted using face-to-face interview techniques and in-depth interview methods. Qualitative data analysis involved using the coding paradigm of Grounded Theory and Straus and Corbin's coding framework. For the analysis of quantitative data, SPSS version 28.0 was employed, while qualitative data were analyzed using MaxQDA Analytics Pro 2022. Result(s): The study found that the participants had a mean age of 47 +/- 7.53, and the majority, 66.7%, had not reached menopause before the operation. The qualitative analysis of the semi-structured interviews revealed five main themes, which were identified as follows: 'hysterectomy experiences', 'the impact of hysterectomy on sexual life', 'the significance attributed to the uterus', 'the significance attributed to femininity', and 'self-efficacy after hysterectomy'. Conclusion(s): The study revealed that women experienced changes in self-perception, body image, a sense of organ loss, and developed negative attitudes towards menopause following a hysterectomy. Additionally, there was a noticeable connection between the meanings attributed to the uterus and femininity, which was often influenced by cultural and social factors. In light of these findings, it is recommended that women receive counseling from healthcare professionals before undergoing a hysterectomy. This guidance can help women better understand and cope with the physical, emotional, and cultural aspects of the procedure.Copyright © 2024, The Author(s).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain, a persistent or recurrent pain lasting more than 3 months, is a widespread problem among military women due to combat-related injuries and post-deployment stressors. Risk factors associated with chronic pain include gender, mental health, post-traumatic stress disorder, and prior physical or military sexual trauma. The most common prevalence of chronic pain is musculoskeletal (e.g., low back and neck), migraine, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. Following deployment, 25% of military women are at risk for chronic pain. Military women are prescribed opioids for pain at a higher rate than men and are at risk for prescription opioid addiction. The unique medical needs of military women, including chronic pain, are poorly understood by health care providers and need to be addressed to achieve full integration into the military. The purpose of this study was to explore a typical day for military women living with chronic pain by examining the participants' daily life experiences. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using van Manen's approach, 13 active duty, retired, and veteran women were interviewed to explore these lived experiences. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of San Diego. RESULT(S): Eight themes emerged from an analysis of the participants' experiences: (1) chronic pain is a frustrating, persistent, daily, and an hourly struggle; (2) resilience in living with chronic pain is the new normal; (3) mission first and the impact of invisible pain; (4) self-care management and internal locus of control with nonpharmacological therapies; (5) pain accepted and managed to improve quality of life; (6) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diminished social interactions; (7) pain of sexual trauma is not reported; and (8) disparities in health care due to self-perception of provider bias as pain is not understood. CONCLUSION(S): The study generated new knowledge in Force Health Protection, ensuring (1) a fit and operational readiness force; (2) pre- to post-deployment care for women warriors; and (3) access to health care. The study findings supported previous research and could help direct future research into nursing, medicine, and allied health treatments for military and veterans' gender-specific health care, education, and training. Furthermore, the military women in this study provided insight into the need for future research to explore unconscious gender bias, health disparities, and a raised awareness of military women living with chronic pain. Findings from this study merit further exploration using other qualitative research methodologies including mixed methods.Copyright © The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2022.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Trauma can play an important role in the development of psychosis, yet no studies have investigated whether a trauma-focused psychological therapy could prevent the onset of psychosis in people at high risk of developing this condition. This study aims to establish whether it would be feasible to conduct a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy to prevent the onset of psychosis in people with an at-risk mental state (ARMS). METHODS/ANALYSIS: This is a single-arm trial with a nested qualitative study where all participants (target n=20) will be offered EMDR. Eligible participants are those who meet criteria for ARMS; have experienced a traumatic event before the onset of ARMS symptomatology; and have at least one symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants will be followed up at 4, 8 and 12 months after the baseline assessment. The primary outcome measure is transition to psychosis, and secondary outcome measures include severity of psychotic symptoms, PTSD, depression, anxiety, impaired functioning, health status and resource use. The analysis will aim to establish the rates of recruitment and retention for a large-scale RCT. Interviews with therapists and patients will explore their views of the study and their experiences of delivering or receiving EMDR. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been approved by the South West-Cornwall and Plymouth Research Ethics Committee (Reference 18/SW/0037). Findings will be disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations and meetings with service users, their families, mental health professionals and commissioners.

T1  - The Efficacy of Cognitive Processing Therapy for PTSD Related to Military Sexual Trauma in Veterans: A Review
A1  - Boehler J. 
Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Women currently comprise 12% of the total number of service personnel who have served in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn. Presently, 15% of active duty personnel, 17% of National Guard personnel, and 20% of new recruits are female. The number of female veterans utilizing the Veterans Health Administration has more than doubled, from 159,000 to 337,000 from 2000-2011 and is expected to double again within the next decade. Similar overall numbers of female and male service members report experiencing military sexual trauma (MST). Prevalence rates vary by study where 20 to 68% of female service members and 1% to 6% of male service members have experienced MST. Many of these service members subsequently develop mental health issues and are diagnosed with conditions related to MST. Purpose(s): The purpose of this review was to summarize outcome studies examining Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for the treatment of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) related to Military Sexual Trauma. Method(s): The informational databases that were utilized for the current review were ERIC (EBSCO), ERIC (ProQuest), Google Scholar, and PsycINFO. The dates for literature inclusion was from 2010 to March of 2019. The literature search was initiated in March and was terminated in April of 2019. Result(s): The results indicated that CPT is an effective intervention for the reduction of MST related PTSD symptoms, including negative cognitions, compared to Present-Centered Therapy (PCT). Additionally, at 6-month post-treatment follow-up symptom reduction was stable. Results were mixed for CPT associated with quality of life and exposure to child Sexual abuse (CSA). Veterans who self-identified as African-American and Caucasian female veterans experienced significant reductions in PTSD symptomology with no differences between groups. Discussion(s): All studies included in the review resulted in significant reductions in PTSD but four of five also suffered from treatment fidelity in the CPT treatment condition. Researchers chose to exclude participant data from the therapists who did not adhere to CPT protocol resulting in a reduction of statistical power in these studies. The final study included in the review administered multiple treatment modalities concurrently.

N2  - Mothering while homeless poses significant barriers in achieving health and unique challenges while parenting without a home. The contextual processes shaping mothers' experiences of social exclusion and homelessness, and the internalized impacts on homeless mothers' lives, are reported on in this article. Critical narrative methodology was employed with 41 participants comprised of 26 mothers experiencing homelessness, and 15 service providers who provided care to mothers experiencing homelessness participated in this study. Two overarching themes were constructed: (1) internalized expectations and regulation and (2) pushing back from the margins: sources of resilience and resistance. Women showed a great deal of agency within the existing structures of exclusion; they worked, and at times fought, tirelessly for safety, housing, their children, and their human rights. They actively demonstrated their agency and resistance within the webs of exclusion they faced. In promoting health, nurses can best support mothers in many ways, such as by employing strengths-based nursing, challenging their own stigma and notions of 'good mothering', and by recognizing and challenging the often insurmountable barriers posed within the system for this population.

Such conditions can result in traumatic lived experiences during childhood, which can carry over into adulthood, influencing their self-perceptions and shaping their attitudes toward themselves and society. To gain insights into this phenomenon, this study explored the lived experiences of adults who grew up with a parent with serious mental illness and their perceptions of their lives in adulthood. DESIGN: This study used an interpretive phenomenological design. METHOD(S): Participants were invited to voluntarily participate in the study through a call posted on social media. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 adults (age range, 20-55years) who grew up with a parent with serious mental illness. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, and inductive thematic analysis was used to identify main and overarching themes. RESULT(S): The overarching theme of transition from childhood survival to adulthood survival emerged and included four main themes: (1) a traumatic childhood, (2) perceived control, (3) resilience and general self-efficacy, and (4) adult quality of life. A traumatic childhood consisted of experiences of neglect and abuse, while participants used perceived control to achieve personal growth, self-care, and care of others. Resilience and general self-efficacy emerged during the transition to adulthood and helped participants further their social status and strengthen family bonds. Lastly, adult quality of life was described as being disturbed by feelings of loneliness and being burdensome, stemming from an inherent tendency to rely solely on themselves, leading to trust issues and mental health complications. Therefore, these adults found it difficult to reach out and get help or treatment for their concerns, as they initially did not want to appear dysfunctional or in need. CONCLUSION(S): This study has illuminated the lived experiences of a specific, vulnerable population that has not been intentionally explored until now. To delve into these experiences, we employed a distinctive qualitative approach, merging the interpretive phenomenological perspective with an inductive thematic analysis. This allowed for rich insight with a relatively large group of participants and enabled an in-depth exploration within this methodological framework. Consequently, this study constitutes a notable contribution to the extant body of knowledge, exploring the intricacies of personal growth and its impact on participants' quality of life. It uncovers the essence of resilience and general self-efficacy, revealing how these elements intertwine with the negative results observed. However, the study findings emphasize the need for healthcare professionals, including nurses and other caregivers, to be mindful of the long-lasting effects of the adverse experiences of children of patients with serious mental illness. Prioritizing active clinical assessment and implementing tailored interventions to address such children's specific needs and difficulties across different developmental stages is imperative. Such comprehensive and targeted approaches are crucial in providing appropriate support and promoting the well-being of these individuals. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Enhanced clinical attention in holistic psychiatric care is crucial for individuals and their relatives, especially children. Comprehensive assessments of children and adults raised by seriously mentally ill parents can enable tailored and preventive interventions, positively impacting overall quality of life.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

N2  - Background: The emergence of the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) pandemic has placed an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Medical personnel on the frontlines have faced unique challenges, including high patient volumes, limited resources, and the constant risk of infection. This study aimed to investigate the mental health status of medical personnel directly involved in treating COVID-19 patients to better understand the impact of the pandemic on their psychological well-being. Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted among medical personnel working in hospitals designated for COVID-19 treatment. A structured questionnaire, including validated mental health assessment tools such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), was administered electronically to assess anxiety, depression, and stress levels. Additionally, demographic and work-related information, including age, gender, job role, and years of experience, were collected. Result(s): A total of 450 medical personnel participated in the study. The results revealed that 65% of the respondents reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, 53% reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression, and 70% reported high levels of perceived stress. Female healthcare workers and those with less than 5 years of experience showed a higher prevalence of psychological distress. Additionally, frontline workers, such as nurses and respiratory therapists, reported significantly higher levels of stress compared to other healthcare professionals. Conclusion(s): The mental health status of medical personnel dealing with COVID-19 is a matter of concern, with a substantial proportion experiencing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and high stress levels. Strategies to support the mental well-being of these healthcare workers should be implemented, including regular mental health screenings, access to counseling services, and the development of targeted interventions to alleviate stress and improve coping mechanisms. Addressing the mental health needs of medical personnel is crucial for ensuring their continued dedication and effectiveness in managing the ongoing pandemic.Copyright © 2023 EManuscript Technologies.

N2  - Introduction:Intersecting behavioral, social, and structural factors increase adolescent girls' (AG) and young women's (YW) HIV vulnerability. Yet, understanding of optimal intervention synergies remains limited. We identified intervention combinations that statistically maximized reductions in AGYW's HIV-related risk. Method(s):Using data collected in 2018 with Zambian AG (n = 487, aged 15-19 years) and YW (n = 505, aged 20-25 years) after 12-14 months exposure to Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe (multisectoral HIV program), we used classification and regression trees to explore relationships between interventions (safe space/social asset building [SAB] and provision of/linkage to youth-friendly health services [YFHS], education social protection [Educ], economic social protection [Econ]) and HIV-related outcomes (HIV testing, consistent condom use, transactional sex, and sexual violence experience from partners and nonpartners). Result(s):Overall, 59.9% completed SAB and 81.5%, 35.4%, and 29.6% received YHFS, Educ, and Econ, respectively. For AG, HIV testing improved (from 73% to 83%) with exposure to all interventions, condom use improved with Econ (from 33% to 46%), transactional sex reduced with SAB + Educ, and sexual violence from partners and nonpartners reduced with Educ and SAB, respectively. For YW, HIV testing increased with Educ (from 77% to 91%), condom use increased with SAB + YFHS (from 36% to 52%), transactional sex reduced with combinations of all interventions, and sexual violence from partners reduced with YFHS and from nonpartners with SAB + Econ. Conclusion(s):Tailored interventions might be more effective than uniform combination intervention packages in reducing AGYW's HIV risk. AG benefitted most from SAB and/or Educ while YFHS, Educ, and/or SAB reduced YW's HIV-related risk. Educational and asset-building interventions could have the greatest impact on AGYW's HIV risk.Copyright © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Computer-mediated and telephone communication connecting professionals and patients (eHealth) is well established. Yet there is little information about psychosocial interventions delivered by trained practitioners for a palliative care population. The aim is to describe digitally enabled psychosocial interventions offered to adults with life-shortening or terminal illnesses and carers/families receiving palliative care, and how these are delivered and evaluated. METHOD(S): Using Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology, 4 databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Academic Search Ultimate) were searched (January 2011-April 2021). Inclusion criteria: (a) any design reporting and (b) psychosocial interventions delivered digitally by palliative care health and social care practitioners to (c) adults with life-shortening illnesses. RESULT(S): Included papers (n=16) were from Europe ((n=8), Asia (n=2), and the USA (n=6). Research designs encompassed pre- and post-studies, randomized control trials, feasibility, and pilot studies. Tools evaluated psychological, somatic, functional, and psychosocial outcomes. Underpinning approaches included cognitive behavioral therapy, Erikson's life review, coping skills training, psychoeducation, problem-solving therapy, counseling, emotional support and advice, and art therapy. Delivery tools used were telephones, text messages and emails, websites, videos, workbooks, and compact discs. Practitioners included counselors, psychotherapists, psychologists, art therapists, social workers, registered nurses, and trainees. Patients had Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, advanced cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: COVID-19 has accelerated the usages of digitally enabled psychosocial interventions. Evidence indicates a growing interest in hybrid, novel, synchronous, and asynchronous digital psychosocial interventions for adults with life-shortening illnesses and their caregivers receiving palliative care.

N2  - Background: Following the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, some patients with initial non-severe forms later develop a state of prolonged symptoms, coined Post Covid-19 Condition (PCC). Frequent manifestations include dysautonomia, fatigue, pain, and cognitive impairment. PCC is a common and debilitating condition in young adults, with a severe impact on work, family, and community life. Specific management and organisation of health care are still evolving. Primary care physicians can accurately treat patients with moderate symptoms. In the Hospices Civils de Lyon, patients with severe or persistent PCC are first seen in an expert consultation (Epsilon consultation) for positive and differential diagnosis, assessment of functional impairment and appropriate symptomatic management. Interestingly, patients with PCC continued to report lacks in the current care pathway as they progressed through rehabilitation. Concerns that frequently emerged from these interviews were fatigue, pain, energy management, anxiety due to uncertainty, loss of work productivity, mood disorders, depression, loss of previous performance and loss of sense of inclusion or belonging. Objective(s): The need for peer support and sharing of experiences led us to create a tailored support group for PCC patients in our Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) unit. Method(s): The Epsilon programme was co-designed with patient partners. Consequently, in subsequent Epsilon consultations, the Epsilon programme was proposed in addition to previous management. Effects were assessed at baseline, at the end of the programme and after 3 months using validated functional status and quality of life scales. Result(s): Later, a group of 8 patients was invited to the first Epsilon programme, which consisted of 6 workshops on 6 consecutive Fridays in March and April 2023. Spontaneous speech by the patients prevailed. Each workshop was dedicated to a specific theme, with appropriate speakers (doctors, physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychomotor therapists, adapted physical activity coaches, psychologists, nurses). The first workshop allowed for an exchange of experiences and scientific explanations on the multifactorial mechanisms of PCC, epidemiological data and continuing scientific questions. Subsequent workshops focused on somatic aspects, psychological aspects, resilience, and identity. A final workshop provided a synthesis of the proposals. Final feedback from patients on their participation allowed us to improve both content and modalities. The next two groups of the Epsilon programme are scheduled for June 2023 and September 2023. Tailored support groups throughout rehabilitation could help patients with PCC to find their own solutions, reduce functional impairment and improve quality of life. The management and healthcare of these patients could be further improved.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Recent research in the fields of women's health, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease presents new opportunities for countering risk and supporting resilience in women's cognitive aging. Women represent two-thirds of individuals currently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and this disparity is impacted by factors related to both biological sex and the social construct of gender. Some sex-based risks to women are unchangeable, such as women's up to 4 times greater dementia risk due to having copies of the apolipoprotein epsilon 4 allele (ApoE E4). At the same time, other sex- and genderinfluenced risks are treatable or amenable to change. For example, women are twice as likely as men to be physically inactive and at twice the risk for depression, both of which are malleable risks for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Women also experience greater brain-based impact of several avoidable or treatable chronic diseases, including sleep apnea and diabetes. Another area of interest is stress effects on sex-based dementia risk. Women have greater odds of experiencing certain kinds of stressors and show sex-specific short and long-term stress responses in the brain and periphery, which in turn may have detrimental effects on memory system function and structure. Beyond these factors, menopause represents a sex-specific dementia risk factor of high current interest. Estrogen directly supports memory and neural plasticity in memory systems. Both monthly fluctuations in estrogen across the menstrual cycle and loss of estrogen at menopause have been associated with measurable changes in brain activity, brain microand macro-structure, and memory performance on standardized tests. Some women's brains may recover poorly from the typical menopause transition, placing them at greater dementia risk. In addition, early and surgical menopause present risk for poor cognitive aging. Despite the daunting nature of women's added dementia risk, understanding these sex-and gender-based risks more deeply can help direct interventions for women's resilience in cognitive aging. This is key, as research shows up to 40% of current cases of dementia and Alzheimer's disease may have been avoided with changes to lifestyle, beginning in early adulthood and continuing throughout the lifespan. To date, evidence points toward critical preventive roles for exercise, stress management, and treating or helping women to avoid risks such as smoking, heavy drinking, diabetes, hypertension, and depression. Intellectual and social engagement have also shown important roles in resilience. Mechanistic and intervention work on these resilience-supporting behaviors is ongoing, and the potentially brain-health supporting role of menopausal hormone therapy remains under investigation. Given the complex and challenging nature of changing lifestyle, support for women's healthy aging requires an early, partnership-based approach, one that appreciates the intersection of sex- and gender-based risks with those risks related to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Women's health providers have unique opportunities to support resilience through educating patients about protecting their brain health through the life span. Taking this proactive approach may significantly reduce the future public health burden of dementia.

N2  - Objective To explore whether there is a mediating role of emotional intelligence between perceived stress and burnout in ICU nurses. Praide a basis for ICU nurses managers to develop corresponding intervention plans. Methods Using a convenience sampling method, 683 nurses in 15 class A tertiary hospitals were conducted a cross-sectional surrey from January to April 2023 using general information, the Chinese version of the Perceived Stress Scale, the Emotional Intelligence Scale, and the Burnout Scale. Results Chinese version of the Perceptual Stress Scale Score (45.59 +/- 6.70), Emotional Intelligence Scale score (57.06 +/- 9.22), Burnout Scale score (54.50 +/- 11.63); pearson correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between perceptual stress and burnout (r = 0.543, P<0.01); emotional intelligence was a negative correlation (r = -0.465, P<0.01). A negative correlation was found between perceived stress and emotional intelligence (r = -0.585, P<0.01); emotional intelligence mediated the effect between perceived stress and burnout, accounting for 24.2% of the total effect. Conclusions Emotional intelligence is a mediating variable between perceived stress and burnout among nurses in ICU. Nursing managers should pay attention to their perceived stress and emotional intelligence levels, regularly assess them, and target take timely interventions to improve emotional management ability and develop resilience to cope with stress, so as to reduce the burnout level of nurses in ICU.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

N2  - Caring for a dying child can be an experience full of all kinds of negative emotions, pain and stress for the pediatric nurse. In this study, which was carried out in Turkey, we aimed to determine how nurses working in a pediatric intensive care unit remembered and made sense of their experiences regarding children's deaths. In-depth interviews were held with 13 nurses. The data were analyzed using the content analysis method. Three themes were identified. These were (1) Personal effects of death, (2) Difficulties in care, and (3) Coping with death. It was clear that the nurses were traumatised by their exposure to infant deaths. The findings showed that nurses experienced regret, fatigue and posttraumatic stress disorder. In addition, it was determined that nurses should be supported to cope with child deaths, which is a complicated process involving the child and the family, especially emotionally. Moreover, providing institutional support to nurses and referring them to cognitive-behavioral therapies may make it easier for them to cope with the emotional burden they carry, as well as the burnout they experience.

N2  - Poly-victimization is often reported by formerly incarcerated women and leads to physical and mental health problems that interfere with daily functioning, sustained employment, and housing stability. Although reentry programs exist, few focus on the physical and emotional impact of multiple traumas. Passport to Freedom (P2F), a woman-centered, trauma-informed reentry program, was developed to support formerly incarcerated women. The pilot intervention, performed in 2017, focused on the connections between trauma and health, coping with symptoms, and managing one's own health. To examine the effectiveness and feasibility of the intervention, we performed the current mixed methods study with two phases: (1) focus groups, and (2) sessions combining mindfulness and health promotion activities with follow-up evaluations. Participants (N = 24) showed decreased symptoms of depression and concerns of everyday stressors after the intervention. Of participants, 84% (n = 16) reported practicing mindfulness and 63% (n = 8) stated that mindfulness exercises helped with daily stress management. The P2F program offers a promising approach to support formerly incarcerated women with health self-management. [Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services, xx(xx), xx-xx.].

N2  - Background: Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more likely to report chronic pain than veterans without PTSD. Yoga has been shown to reduce both chronic pain and PTSD symptoms in clinical trials. The goal of our study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that combined yoga and mantram repetition (Yoga + MR) into one program for military veterans with both chronic pain and PTSD. Method(s): In this feasibility RCT, 27 veterans were randomized to either Yoga + MR or a relaxation intervention. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person recruitment, assessments, and intervention attendance were re-evaluated. Although remote delivery of aspects of the study were utilized, interventions were delivered in-person. Feasibility benchmarks met included full recruitment in 12 months or less, 75%+ retention at initial follow-up assessment, 50%+ attendance rate, and 75%+ of participants satisfied with the interventions. Result(s): The sample was racially and ethnically diverse, and 15% of participants were women. Participant recruitment lasted approximately 11 months. Out of 32 participants initially randomized, two participants asked to be dropped from the study and three did not meet PTSD symptom criteria. For the remaining 27 participants, retention rates were 85% at 12 weeks and 81% at 18 weeks. Participants attended 66% of in-person yoga and 55% of in-person relaxation sessions. Satisfaction was high, with 100% of yoga participants and 75%/88% of relaxation participants agreeing or strongly agreeing they were satisfied with the intervention/instructors. After 12 weeks (end of intervention), Yoga + MR participants reported reduced back-pain related disability (primary outcome), reduced alcohol use, reduced fatigue, and increased quality of life, while relaxation group participants reported reductions in pain severity, PTSD symptoms, and fatigue. Conclusion(s): Amidst many research challenges during the pandemic, recruitment, retention, and efficacy results from this feasibility trial support advancement to a larger RCT to study Yoga + MR for chronic pain and PTSD.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Background: The genetic condition of oculocutaneous albinism is disproportionately present in Africa. Little research has addressed the experiences of mothers impacted by albinism, even though they are more likely to be impacted by human rights violations. Method(s): A qualitative study was designed to examine the resilience of mothers affected by albinism in South Africa. Virtual and in-person fieldwork was conducted with the facilitation of community-based researchers and local cultural liaisons. Finding(s): Giving birth to a child with albinism in South Africa, as in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, was a life-defining moment for mothers and their families, setting them on a trajectory of health-related stigma, gender inequalities, reduced access to social determinants of health, and other human rights violations. Mothers engaged in sense-making processes shaped by the responses of birth attendants and families, and that reflected social discourses. Their resilience was impacted by access to health teaching, genetic counselling, and health and social services, which were often incomplete or absent all together. Civil society organizations, peer groups, and faith communities were vital in filling these gaps. Conclusion(s): The experience giving birth to a child with albinism was both the same and different compared to mothers forty years earlier. What varied was the digital availability of health information; progressive health and social policies and resourcing; and human rights instruments. These transformations point to best practices to support mothers' resilience.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s)

N2  - Introduction: The mental health of medical students is of critical importance during their medical studies, which can be a long and challenging period. Academic expectations, high workload, and emotional stress can contribute to mental burden and burnout among medical students, placing an increased burden on the healthcare system in the future. Therefore, psychological support and mental health services play a crucial role in medical education. Objective(s): The aim of this study is to present and examine the role of the Psychological Counseling Service at the University of P cs Medical School in supporting the mental health of medical students since its establishment in 2007. Method(s): In this study, we present the combined quantitative and qualitative results from the period between November 2021 and May 2023, as registered by the students and staff utilizing the Service as well as the counseling psychologists working at the Service. The data include the number of consultations, the patterns of the most frequently occurring problems (based on the Counseling Professional Protocol), and the mental well-being of the population receiving psychological support (GHQ-12). Result(s): During the examined period, a total of 1111 individuals made use of the Service in 2012 appointments. Both students and staff most commonly sought assistance from the Service in addressing relationship difficulties (37.6%) and coping with negative life events (33.1%). Based on the data collected since October 2022 (n = 113), nearly 10% of the attendees were taking medication for psychiatric treatment, a significantly higher percentage among international students. Furthermore, 38.9% had previously received professional help. The average score on the GHQ-12 questionnaire is 8 points, which is significantly above the 5-point threshold achieved by 78.6% of respondents. Conclusion(s): The results demonstrate that the Psychological Counseling Service at the University of P cs Medical School plays a significant role in supporting the mental health of medical students. It contributes to more effective coping with academic challenges, reducing the risk of emotional stress and burnout.Copyright © Szerzo(k).

T1  - Personality and vocational interest typologies associated with better coping and resilience in paramedicine: A review of two models
A1  - Mason R.
A1  - Roodenburg J.
A1  - Williams B. 
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Paramedics' continued exposure to work-related stressors can negatively impact emotional wellbeing. Having or developing resilience contributes to better coping. Understanding differences in individual predispositions as they relate to resilience and coping can provide a needed understanding of why some people flourish while others are more at risk, with important implications for identifying and facilitating bespoke support for paramedics more at risk. The purpose of this article then is firstly to review two of the main well-validated models of innate dispositions in differential psychology, widely used in organisational and industrial psychology: personality and vocational interests. These are The Big-Five/Five-Factor Model and Holland's RIASEC. Then, we report which dispositions are an advantage for paramedic coping and resilience. Concerning personality, our findings from the literature suggest that for paramedics, lower levels of Neuroticism and Openness, and higher levels of Extraversion, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness are associated with higher resilience and better coping. RIASEC associations suggest person-environment congruence is also related to resilience and coping, this being for those with the profession's predominant Holland code of RSI (Realist, Social and Investigative inclinations). Paramedics approximating these preferences are, it appears, innately relatively less at risk of the negative effects associated with occupational stressors in paramedicine. Stressors typically include post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression and other psychological reactions that all can result in suicide. Importantly, such resilience does not mean an individual is instinctively protected from some form of emotional suffering. The implications of verifying the significance of predispositions implies the need to harness organisational psychology as part of training courses, and the need for involvement of psychologists in the field, both preventatively and in clinical care.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health has been widely concerned, but the research on positive psychological factors is insufficient, this study aims to investigate the prevalence and factors of posttraumatic growth (PTG) among residents in the worst-hit areas of China (Hubei Province). We were conducted in three disaster areas with different severity in Hubei Province three months after the outbreak, and the data were from 575 respondents. Instruments included the simplified Chinese version of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (C-PTGI) and the public health emergency psychological questionnaire. Nonparametric tests, Spearman correlation analyses, and multiple linear regression equations were used to analyze the data. The results showed that three months after the outbreak of COVID-19, the PTG of Hubei residents was at a low level, and their sense of fear was the most prominent, with a positive detection rate of 82.09%. According to the results of this study, high PTG levels were associated with high levels of fear, married and healthcare providers, while low levels of PTG were associated with serious chronic diseases, males, good economic status, and poor prevention and control measures. Government departments should strengthen social support for residents, carry out necessary stress management training to help them correctly deal with negative emotions and promote their personal growth.

N2  - Background and aims: Issues: Social stigma, Fatigue, sexual dysfunction, Sleeplessness, depression commonly seen in Parkinson's patients. Palliative inaccessible in rural/tribal areas. Hence our NGO nurses took initiatives to help alleviate suffering of women with Parkinson patients since October 2018. Objective(s): n = 110. Of these statistically over 90 % express sexual-dysfunction, 68 % experience loneliness; 70 % suffer social neglect/humiliation, 64 % had depression. Importance of spirituality/religion in coping with terminal-illness is increasingly recognized Hence Our NGO-nurses involved community-leaders to make more women involved in our spiritual healing sessions. Method(s): We surveyed 110 subjects through QOL-questionnaires. After 22 weeks therapy with psychosocial support. Counseling & palliative care with anti-depressants/pain-killers/nutrition, QOL improved to statistically significant level. Requirement of palliative care evaluated by Palliative Care Problem Severity Scale (PCPSS). Traditional faith-healers involved for more psychological impact on patients community. Community leaders involved to reduce social stigma/discrimination among community. Result(s): Currently 210 specialist palliative care beds required for our Rural/tribal population of 16,00,000. But only 80 available. 60 % expressed that religious/community support/faith was most important factor that helped them to cope with Parkinson's. higher scores of QOL (ANOVA p < 0.001) correlated with lack of sexual dysfunction/pain. Our NGO-initiative suggests that over 70 % patients will need well trained specialist for home-based-care. Conclusion(s): Life-span/QOL of Parkinson patients-sufferers depends on social acceptance & appropriate-palliative-care. NGO-personals should be trained in Palliative-care-services. Field of Spiritual/psycho-social/community support is fertile ground for further investigations. We need focused platform like WCN to discuss our project ideas/concerns/difficulties with senior researchers.Copyright © 2023

N2  - The paper highlights the notion that different emotional states can occur as reactions to climate change, ranging from a sense of minor distress and anxiety to mental disorders pertaining to the group of stress-related disorders, anxiety disorders, mood disorders and sleep disorders, all depending on the psychological resilience of individuals and the supportive factors in their surroundings and the society. It is necessary to work towards developing resilience, protective factors and mechanisms for coping with climate change at the individual as well as the community and societal levels. It is of particular importance to build resilience in sensitive individuals and populations, and to ensure the availability of adequate care and treatment with the help of the competent emergency services. The paper emphasises the importance of stress reaction prevention and adaptation to the consequences of events resulting from climate change and the early provision of psychological and psychiatric support to those in need.Copyright © 2023 Medicinska Naklada Zagreb.

T1  - Deployment-related quarantining-a risk or resilience factor for German military service members? A prospective analysis during the third-fifth waves of COVID-19
A1  - Buhler A.H.
A1  - Willmund G.-D. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Background: Mandatory deployment-related quarantining added further constraints on soldiers during the pandemic. Contrary to overwhelming research documenting an adverse impact of quarantining on mental health, no adverse short-term mental health effects of pre-deployment quarantining for German soldiers were identified. Therefore, we are interested in a potentially delayed onset, the impact of an additional post-deployment quarantine, and quarantine-associated risk and resilience factors predicting mental health post-deployment. Method(s): In a prospective research design, 928 German soldiers enrolled in the study at the in-processing of pre-deployment quarantine between February 2021 and March 2022. Every German military service member undergoing pre-deployment quarantine could participate. The soldiers were between 18 and 64years old; 87.5% identified as male and 12.5% as female. Self-reported mental health (Mini-SCL), perceived social support (FSozU-K22), and perceived unit cohesion were assessed three to five times: at the beginning and the end of pre-deployment quarantine (Nt1=928, Nt2=907), if still mandatory-at the beginning and the end of post-deployment quarantine (Nt3=143 and Nt4=132), and 3months post-deployment, on average 7 to 8months later than pre-deployment quarantine (Nt5=308). The analyzed quarantine-associated risk and resilience factors were informedness about COVID-19, infection risk, quarantine benefit, clarity of quarantine protocol, need for intimacy/bonding, norms, stigma, practicality, financial disadvantages, boredom, and health-promoting leadership. Result(s): Despite four different mental health trajectories identified, repeated measures ANOVAs revealed a significant improvement in mental health post-deployment (F[2,265]=21.54, p<0.001), a small decrease in social support (F[2,266]=16.85, p<0.001), and no significant changes in unit cohesion (F[2,264]=0.482, p=0.618) 3months post-deployment. Using stepwise regression, 24% of variance in mental health symptomatology post-deployment is predicted pre-deployment by a clear quarantine protocol, unit cohesion, intimacy/bonding, and social support (F[4,263]=22.23, p<0.001). In total, 30% of mental health at the end of post-deployment quarantine is predicted by stigma and a clear quarantine protocol (F[2,99]=22.22, p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Although no overall adverse impact of quarantining on mental health was found, it is recommended to address perceived stigma and clearly communicate the quarantine protocol, and to further follow up on the perceived decrease in social support.Copyright © 2023 Buhler and Willmund.

N2  - BACKGROUND Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline nurses have experienced psychological problems. However, the depression of frontline nurses in Wuhan 6 months after the outbreak of COVID-19 has not been studied adequately. The purpose of this study was to investigate the depression of frontline nurses in Wuhan 6 months after the COVID-19 outbreak and to analyze possible risk and protective factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were collected through Wenjuanxing from 612 frontline nurses in Wuhan national COVID-19-designated hospitals between July 27, 2020, and August 12, 2020. The levels of depression, family functioning, and psychological resilience were assessed among frontline nurses in Wuhan with a depression scale, family function scale, and 10-item psychological resilience scale, respectively. The factors associated with depressive symptoms were identified using the chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 126 respondents were included in the study. The overall prevalence of depression was 25.2%. The need for mental health services was a potential risk factor for depressive symptoms, while family functioning and psychological resilience were potential protective factors. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major challenge to the depressive symptoms of frontline nursing in Wuhan, highlighting the need for all frontline nurses in Wuhan to be screened for depression regularly for timely intervention. CONCLUSIONS To mitigate the impact of the pandemic on depression, psychological interventions for frontline nurses need to be implemented to preserve their mental health.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Nephrology nurses are not immune to the effects of a stressful work environment. As a result, their emotional and psychological health can be at risk. In addition, there has been unprecedented stress and uncertainty working as nephrology nurses during the pandemic. These stressors can have negative effects on nurses' health, resulting in burnout and/or compassion fatigue, which can lead to nurses leaving nephrology or the nursing profession. Mindfulness has been suggested as a strategy to mitigate work-related stressors and build a more resilient workforce. Our experience suggests that combining self-compassion practices with mindfulness is also effective. Mindfulness may be beneficial for nephrology nurses, but its use does not negate the need for organizations to address the structural system issues that also contribute to burnout.Copyright© by the American Nephrology Nurses Association.

N2  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health concern, causing millions of cases and deaths worldwide. India, particularly Karnataka, grapples with a significant TB burden, imposing a substantial economic strain on affected individuals and their families. Hospitalization for TB treatment is crucial but often results in financial distress, hindering inpatient care access due to exorbitant costs, leading to catastrophic medical expenses for many households. Objective(s): This study evaluates the utilization of TB-specific healthcare packages within the AB-PMJAY-ArK in Karnataka State. The primary objective is to assess utilization patterns based on socio-demographic factors, geographical distribution, healthcare facility types, and the cost savings for TB patients and their families. Method(s): Utilizing observational data from the AB-PMJAY-ArK preauthorization and claims database through Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST) portal, this study covers a 24-month period from July 2021 to June 2023. TB-specific treatment packages were identified, and descriptive statistics were employed for analysis. Result(s): Of the 39,89,802 approved preauthorizations, 9173 patients with confirmed TB were analysed. Majority were male (68.3 %) and belonged to the below poverty line category (96.2 %). The public sector accounted for 97.9 % of TB treatment, with 96.4 % of approved preauthorization amounts. On average, the scheme averted catastrophic costs of approximately Rs. 10,000 per TB patient. Various healthcare facilities were utilized, with medical colleges being the most frequented. Conclusion(s): Addressing the financial burden of TB hospitalization is crucial for ensuring equitable healthcare access. While AB-PMJAY-ArK has made significant strides in alleviating financial distress, policymakers and healthcare providers can amplify its impact through targeted interventions, healthcare system strengthening, and fostering public-private collaborations. Further research is needed to assess the long-term effects of these measures on patient outcomes and healthcare systems. This study provides valuable insights into strategies for mitigating financial distress resulting from TB hospitalization, with the potential to support the sustainable management of this global health challenge and enhance healthcare system resilience.Copyright © 2023 Tuberculosis Association of India

N2  - To understand the level of post-traumatic growth (PTG) and influencing factors among front-line healthcare workers (HCWs) working in mobile cabin hospitals treating patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) under the Normalized Epidemic Prevention and Control Requirements adopted in China. A random sampling method was used to select 540 HCWs of the Chongqing-aid-Shanghai medical team from April to May 2022 as the study participants. Participants completed a general information questionnaire, the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory-Chinese version (PTGI-C), the Chinese version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and the Chinese Event Related Rumination Inventory (C-ERRI). Among the 540 included HCWs, 83.15 % were nurses and 78.89 % were women. The average scores for PTG (62.25 +/- 16.73) and psychological resilience (64.22 +/- 15.38) were at moderate levels, and the average score for rumination was low (21.62 +/- 10.77). Pearson correlation analysis showed that CD-RISC and C-ERRI scores were positive with the PTGI-C score (r = 0.528, 0.316, P < 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis identified psychological training or intervention during the COVID-19 epidemic (beta = 2.353, P = 0.044), psychological resilience (beta = 0.525, P < 0.001) and deliberate rumination (beta = 0.732, P < 0.001) as factors significantly associated with the PTG of front-line HCWs, which together explained 36.8 % of the total variance in PTG (F[5,539] = 63.866, P < 0.001). In general, psychological resilience and deliberate rumination can promote PTG among HCWs and can be improved by strengthening psychological training and interventions for HCWs working under the Normalized Epidemic Prevention and Control Requirements.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Introduction The climate crisis has serious consequences for many areas of life. This applies in particular to human health - also in Europe. While cardiovascular, pneumological and dermatological diseases related to the climate crisis are often discussed, the crisis' significant gastroenterological consequences for health must also be considered. Methods A literature search (Pubmed, Cochrane Library) was used to identify papers with relevance particularly to the field of gastroenterology in (Central) Europe. Findings were supplemented and discussed by an interdisciplinary team. Results The climate crisis impacts the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal diseases in Europe due to more frequent and severe heat waves, flooding and air pollution. While patients with intestinal diseases are particularly vulnerable to acute weather events, the main long-term consequences of climate change are gastrointestinal cancer and liver disease. In addition to gastroenteritis, other infectious diseases such as vector-borne diseases and parasites are important in the context of global warming, heat waves and floods. Discussion Adaptation strategies must be consistently developed and implemented for vulnerable groups. Patients at risk should be informed about measures that can be implemented individually, such as avoiding heat, ensuring appropriate hydration and following hygiene instructions. Recommendations for physical activity and a healthy and sustainable diet are essential for the prevention of liver diseases and carcinomas. Measures for prevention and the promotion of resilience can be supported by the physicians at various levels. In addition to efforts fostering sustainability in the immediate working environment, a system-oriented commitment to climate protection is important.Copyright © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

N2  - People experiencing homelessness report increased exposure to traumatic life events and higher rates of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder as compared with the general population. Heart rate variability-biofeedback (HRV-BF) has been shown to decrease symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. However, HRV-BF has not been tested with the most vulnerable of populations, homeless adults. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the effectiveness of an HRV-BF intervention versus a Health Promotion (HP) active control intervention focused on improving mental health symptoms among homeless adults. Guided by a community advisory board, homeless adults residing in Skid Row, Los Angeles (n = 40) were randomized to either the HRV-BF or an active HP control group and received eight weekly, 30-min sessions over two months, delivered by a nurse-led community health worker team. Dependent variables of HRV, mental health, anxiety, depression, and PTSD were measured at baseline, the 8-week session, and/or 2-month follow-up. All intervention sessions were completed by 90% (36/40) of participants. Both the HRV-BF and HP interventions showed significant increases in HRV from baseline to 2-month follow-up, with no significant difference between the intervention groups. The HRV-BF programme revealed a somewhat greater, although non-significant, improvement in anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms than the HP programme. The usefulness of both interventions, focused on emotional and physical health, warrants future studies to examine the value of a combined HRV-BF and HP intervention.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: To study the emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers in Ukraine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Material(s) and Method(s): 1087 healthcare workers across all regions of Ukraine completed an online questionnaire. Respondents were divided into two groups: A - 863 (79.4%), B - 224 (20.6%), according to whether or not they experienced anxiety/fear related to COVID-19. RESULT(S): Results: Such factors as risk of contracting COVID-19, news of new cases, insufficient staff in healthcare facilities, risk of transmission of COVID-19 to family or friends, risk of death from COVID-19, the threat of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with high level of anxiety/fear among healthcare workers. Factors that facilitate coping with stress included absence of Covid-19 cases among staff, recovering patients, availability of gear and protective equipment and absence of COVID-19 infected among loved ones, relieving stress (relaxation, going info sports and so on), communication with family and friends to relieve stress and get support, avoidance of COVID-19 media reports in particular on deaths connected cases, getting information about the spread of Covid-19 only from legitimate sources. CONCLUSION(S): Conclusion(s): The data obtained in this study indicate an urgent need for the development and implementation of preventive and rehabilitation measures aimed at stabilizing the psycho-emotional state of health workers and improving the quality of care in the special conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Achieving these goals will be facilitated by taking into account the specifics of the response to COVID-19 and measures to reduce the effects of stress while enhancing the effects of stressors among health care workers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Early adolescence is an important period to lay the foundation for positive sexual health development that can overcome sexual and reproductive health (SRH) challenges faced by very young adolescents (VYAs) as they reach puberty and sexual debut. In this study, we explored the following questions: first, what are the experiences of VYA girls on DREAMS' Go Girl club participation? Second, how does club participation influence the VYAs SRH knowledge to reduce their risk for HIV and negative sexual health outcomes? METHODS: This was a qualitative study in which twenty-three in-depth interviews were conducted with VYA girls aged 12-14years. These girls were enrolled in girl-only clubs in two rural southern districts in Malawi. The clubs were a part of larger comprehensive HIV prevention project called DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe) which provided an evidence-based core package of interventions to VYAs to prevent HIV. Interventions included improved access to key health services, education support, social skills, asset building, and economic strengthening. Narrative inquiry was used to generate first-hand accounts of the girls' experiences with club participation. Thematic analysis was used to generate themes from the transcribed stories. RESULT(S): Six main themes were generated: 1) reasons for joining the clubs with desire to learn about SRH as a motivation for joining the clubs.; 2) influence on gender norms and roles whereby participants described a change of gender roles and norms at home; 3) influence on child abuse practices whereby participants reported a decline in child abusive practices at home;4) influence on life skills and social networks whereby participants described learning about networking; 5) support to go back to school whereby out-of-school girls described how economic empowerment of their guardians facilitated their return to school; and 6) influence of clubs on SRH knowledge acquisition and behaviours whereby participants described acquiring knowledge on sexual health issues. CONCLUSION(S): Girls-only HIV and SRH programs coupled with economic empowerment for their families can be effective in keeping VYA girls in school and improving SRH knowledge and health seeking behavior.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Psychosocial empowerment of cancer survivors can help improve their psychological resilience and enhance their posttraumatic growth. However, there is a lack of research exploring the effects of such empowerment programs on resilience and posttraumatic growth of cancer survivors. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of an integrated empowerment program on cancer survivors. METHOD(S): We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 89 adult cancer survivors (>25 years old) from 2 oncology hospitals. Using a table of random numbers, they were assigned randomly to the experimental group (n = 45), which participated in 10 sessions of a structured empowerment program, and the control group (n = 44), which received only routine care and no further intervention. Data were collected from patients using the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory and the Resilience Scale for Adults. RESULT(S): Posttraumatic growth and resilience levels significantly improved in the intervention group compared with the control group both at the end of and a month after the program. CONCLUSION(S): This study's empowerment program is effective in improving posttraumatic growth and resilience levels of cancer survivors who are prone to trauma. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: By enhancing resilience and posttraumatic growth of cancer survivors, the empowerment program may help restore life, and thus its application can contribute to the psychosocial well-being of cancer survivors. Nurses with training and experience can integrate this kind of program into clinical settings.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Sexual assault (SA) is a serious crime that is a prevalent mental and public health problem. AIMS: Addressing the needs of SA victims and providing appropriate treatment are essential to reduce potential adverse short- and long-term outcomes. METHOD(S): Our team undertook an extensive systematic literature review (published between January 2006 and July 2021) to provide evidence-based mental health intervention recommendations for adolescent and adult victims of SA. Where SA-specific research was limited, the literature and clinical practice guidelines on treatments for trauma-induced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were reviewed to provide additional information to formulate recommendations. RESULT(S): Findings strongly support several primary psychotherapy treatments: cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive processing therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, narrative exposure therapy, and prolonged exposure therapy. Complementary (aerobic exercise, art, drama, and music therapy) and pharmacological treatments were explored. CONCLUSION(S): Mental health nurses who provide services for victims of SA can utilize this overview to guide recommendations for treatment of SA trauma and related PTSD symptoms to mitigate the short- and long-term negative impacts after a traumatic event. When victims of SA receive optimal mental health treatments, our communities benefit as victims heal and recover.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Compassion fatigue is often associated with moral distress in the nursing practice among registered nurses. Moral resilience is an important ability to maintain, restore, or promote their physical and mental health in response to ethical dilemmas in nursing. Moral resilience can be utilized as a potential solution to aid registered nurses in effectively managing compassion fatigue. AIM: To identify latent profiles of moral resilience among registered nurses and to explore the relationships of these profiles with compassion fatigue. RESEARCH DESIGN: From August 2022 to December 2022, 569 nurses were recruited in two general hospitals, in China. A Rushton Moral Resilience Scale and the Chinese version of Compassion Fatigue-Short Scale were given to the participants. A latent profile analysis was conducted to explore moral resilience latent profiles. Predictors of profiles membership was evaluated using multinomial logistic regression analysis, and the compassion fatigue scores of each latent profile were compared using a one-way analysis of variance. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: We obtained ethical approval from the Institution Review Board of Xiangya School of Nursing, Central South University (IRB No. E202293, approved 15/July/2022). RESULT(S): A four-profile moral resilience model best fit the data. Different levels and shapes differentiated the four profiles: high moral resilience (28.7%), moderate moral resilience (52.3%), low responses and high efficacy (16.2%), and low moral resilience (2.8%). Nurses with bachelor's degrees were more likely to belong to the high moral resilience (OR = 0.118, p = .038) and moderate moral resilience (OR = 0.248, p = .045); Nurses who were divorced or separated (OR = 11.746, p = .025) and very dissatisfied with their work (OR = 0.001, p = .049) were more probably belonging to low moral resilience. Nurses who had received ethical training in the hospital were more likely involved in high moral resilience (OR = 5.129, p = .003) and low responses and high efficacy (OR = 5.129, p = .003). In each profile of moral resilience, compassion fatigue was experienced differently by the participants (F = 13.05, p < .001). CONCLUSION(S): Developing and implementing interventions tailored to each nurse's moral resilience profile would maximize interventions' effectiveness and reduce nurses' compassion fatigue.

N2  - Background: China has experienced a surge period of COVID-19 pandemic since December 2022. Healthcare workers (HCWs) were exposed to huge workload under high risk of being infected, and significant levels of trauma, which might cause Post-traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) symptoms in HCWs. Objective(s): To identify the prevalence of PTSD symptoms among HCWs in the Chinese mainland during the surge period of the COVID-19 pandemic; to explore their psycho-social factors of PTSD symptoms. Method(s): A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs in Chinese mainland from January 5 to February 9, 2023, covering seven geographical regions. 6552 participants were recruited by convenience sampling. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, work-related factors, and psychological factors by online questionnaires. Univariate analysis and binary logistic regression were used to determine the influencing factors of PTSD symptoms. Result(s): The prevalence of PTSD symptoms among HCWs was 37.49 %. A higher level of mindfulness, resilience, and perceived social support were protective factors. Female gender, nurses, higher educational attainment, married status, more working years, higher perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 due to work, and higher perceived work intensity were risk factors. Conclusion(s): High prevalence of PTSD symptoms among HCWs necessitates psychological interventions. Tailored interventions, designed by professional psychiatrists, should be tailored to address the stressors. A comprehensive approach, incorporating mindfulness, resilience-building, and perceived social support enhancement, is vital to bolster the mental well-being of HCWs exposed to traumatic events, thus mitigating the impact of PTSD effectively. Additionally, it is essential to provide support to HCWs with other potential risk factors.Copyright © 2023

N2  - The Resilience Assessment Grid (RAG) has gained increasing traction in healthcare discourse for its effectiveness in understanding and assessing the potential resilient performance of healthcare organisations. RAG is intended to be tailored for the specific organisation. However, developing a context specific RAG questionnaire can be time-consuming, limiting its widespread implementation. The current study aimed to investigate whether an existing Danish RAG questionnaire for outpatient clinics could be successfully content validated and applied in another outpatient clinic context. A modified Delphi method was used to content validate the Danish RAG questionnaire in the Australian outpatient clinic setting, using interviews and expert panel reviews. The 29-item English version of the RAG questionnaire was administered in 2023 to nine managers and five healthcare professionals responding on a five-point Likert scale, who work across 34 hospital outpatient clinics at Macquarie University (MQ) Health Clinics. The questionnaire was also employed during managerial and departmental meetings in a collaborative learning format. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data, which was then presented using radar charts to facilitate the interpretation of the resilient profiles of MQ Health Clinics. The translation and validation of the Danish RAG questionnaire was successful. The English language RAG questionnaire was perceived as useful by managers to assess their clinics' resilient strengths and weaknesses and identify areas for improvement within their clinic. While the RAG methodology highlights the importance of context-specificity, this study's findings suggest that the content validated RAG questionnaire has the potential for application in other outpatient settings with minimal adaptation.Copyright © 2023

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic posed substantial challenges to healthcare systems globally and severely disrupted essential health services, including routine immunization programs. In India, these disruptions were exacerbated due to the sudden emergence of the pandemic and lockdown measures, leading to mass migrations and a shortage of healthcare workers. Caregivers' concerns about routine immunization sessions further compounded the problem, resulting in a sharp increase in zero-dose children. This review paper examines India's strategies for conducting one of the world's largest COVID-19 vaccination programs while effectively restoring and perpetuating its Universal Immunization Program (UIP). The UIP played a pivotal role in sustaining immunization services during the pandemic, ultimately improving immunization coverage compared to pre-pandemic levels. India's accomplishments in this regard are highlighted through key performance indicators, the reach of immunization services, a reduction in zero-dose children, and antigen-wise coverage. The paper also discusses the successful integration of COVID-19 vaccination within the UIP framework, underscoring the significance of existing infrastructure, technology, and capacity building. India's dedication to concurrently managing routine immunization and COVID-19 vaccination showcases the adaptability and resilience of its healthcare system. India's journey serves as a global example of efficient mass immunization during challenging times, emphasizing the importance of political will, healthcare infrastructure investment, skilled healthcare workforces, and comprehensive vaccination programs. In a world grappling with the dual challenge of COVID-19 and routine immunization, India's experience provides a roadmap for strengthening healthcare systems and promoting public health as the critical agenda in challenging times.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

N2  - Objective To describe families' experiences of antenatal counselling of spina bifida. Design Systematic review. Methods MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Embase databases were searched using a combination of Medical Subject Headings and text/abstract terms. Case reports, survey results and qualitative interview data were included. The quality of research was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Results 8 papers were included. Families described shock and grief at diagnosis, with some immediately offered termination of pregnancy (TOP) even though they knew little about the condition. Positive and negative aspects of care were found. Teams that were gentle, kind and empathetic, who did not use jargon, and highlighted positive and negative aspects of the baby's life were seen favourably. Callous language, and overly negative or incorrect counselling was not, particularly if there was pressure to agree to TOP. Families based their decisions on how they would cope, the effect on siblings and the baby's likely quality of life. Prenatal surgery was viewed positively. The views of families who chose TOP, were happy with their care, partners, families, and the LGBTQ+ community were under-represented in the literature. Conclusions Unlike other conditions where limited data on outcome exist or the spectrum is genuinely broad, the outcomes of children with spina bifida is well described. Poor aspects of antenatal counselling were described frequently by families, and further work is needed to capture the full spectrum of views on antenatal counselling, how it can be improved, and what training and resources healthcare professionals need to perform it better.Copyright © 2024 BMJ Publishing Group.

N2  - The rise in task-shared interventions that address the mental health treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has highlighted the need for additional support and supervision of nonspecialist mental health workers (NHWs). The supervision of NHWs in most resource-limited settings is still primarily disorganized, without clear guidelines that provide the necessary structure for supervision. The need for supervision is even greater for NHWs working in the context of trauma, not only to provide training and ensure adequate delivery of care but also to provide support to minimize the psychological impact of their work. In South Africa, women face intersecting epidemics of HIV, intimate partner violence, and sexual trauma. This syndemic highlights the importance of integrating mental health treatment in HIV care, especially in settings like South Africa, where mental health services are limited. In this context, our group developed and is evaluating the effectiveness of ImpACT+, a task-shared coping intervention to improve clinical and mental health outcomes among HIV-infected women with sexual trauma in South Africa. We describe the ImpACT+ supervision model that is currently being implemented in the context of a hybrid effectiveness-implementation clinical trial. Combining experiences from clinical psychology, task-shared interventions, and trauma-informed care, the supervision model integrates formal elements of clinical supervision into categories that are suitable for use in task-shared trauma interventions in low-resource settings. To the best of our knowledge, such a trauma-informed supervision approach has not been widely documented in the literature, particularly in task-shared interventions in LMICs. In this article, we describe the ImpACT+ intervention, provide an overview of the supervision model, and provide illustrative examples of how the supervision model has been implemented.Copyright © Rabie et al.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of the research was to portray the life experiences of adolescents using psychoactive substances with regard to their substance use. DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was carried out in a descriptive phenomenological design, which is a qualitative research method. A purposeful sampling method, was used. The sample consisted of 15 adolescents who were treated for a history of substance use. The data were collected by the face-to-face individual interview method. A personal information form and a semi-structured interview form were used to collect data. The content analysis approach proposed by Graneheim and Lundman was used in the analysis of the data. Data were analyzed using the N-VIVO-10 Pro-package program. RESULT(S): Four main themes and thirteen sub-themes were determined: experiences before substance use (sub-themes: life before substance use, predisposing factors for substance use), experiences during substance use (sub-themes: symptoms of addiction, problems caused by substance use, family attitude to substance use, the meaning attached to substances) and experiences of the treatment process (sub-themes: motivation, difficulties experienced during treatment, the need for support, treatment results), prevention recommendations (sub-themes: for peers, for families, for society). CONCLUSION(S): Many individual, family and social risk factors had an effect on the adolescents starting to use the substances. They were exposed to negative physical, mental, economic, social and life experiences. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Nurses working with adolescents who use substances can implement nursing interventions such as prevention activities, counselling, health education, coping and strengthening self-esteem in individual and school based interventions.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: Few studies have examined the association between parental quality time and flourishing measures in young children. This study explored the association between parental quality time and children's flourishing in a national sample of USA children 1-5 years of age. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross sectional study using data from the 2019-2020 National Survey of Children's Health (N = 17,855). Flourishing was measured with a composite score (values 0-4) derived from 4 questions on attachment with parent, resilience, learning, and contentment with life. Having all 4 items was optimal. Parent-child quality time per week was measured with 3 items: singing or storytelling, reading to child, and family meal with child; using a 4-point scale: 0 days, 1-3 days, 4-6 days, and every day/week. Multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to assess the odds of lower flourishing in SAS 9.4. RESULT(S): After controlling for confounding, only the lack of singing and storytelling were negatively associated with greater odds of lower levels of flourishing (0-2 items OR = 5.06, 95% CI 2.11-12.14; 3 items OR = 2.92, 95% CI 1.73-4.93). CONCLUSION(S): Insufficient parent-child quality time is associated with lower flourishing levels. Fostering parental opportunities to engage in weekly quality time with their children should be a priority of child health programs seeking to improve child flourishing. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Nurses should provide guidance to parents on ways to nurture quality family time and promote children's psychosocial, environmental, and physical well-being. Nurses can advocate for programmatic and policy changes to ensure familial work/life balance and licensing/accreditation of all child centers.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To perform geographic contour analysis of sea and land ambulance rescue times in an archipelago subject to super typhoons; to design point-of-care testing strategies for medical emergencies and weather disasters made more intense by global warming and rising oceans; and to assess needs for prehospital testing on spatial care paths that accelerate decision making, increase efficiency, improve outcomes, and enhance standards of care in island nations. METHOD(S): We performed needs assessments, inspected healthcare facilities, and collected ambulance rescue times from professionals in the Bantayan Archipelago, Philippines. We mapped sea/land ambulance rescue routes and time contours. To reveal gaps, we statistically compared the fastest and slowest patient rescue times from islands/islets and barangays to the District Hospital on Bantayan Island. We developed spatial care paths (the fastest routes to care) for acute myocardial infarction, community care, and infectious diseases. We generated a compendium of prehospital diagnostic testing and integrated outcomes evidence, diagnostic needs, and public health goals to recommend point-of-care strategies that build geographic health resilience. RESULT(S): We observed limited access to COVID-19 assays, absence of blood gas/pH testing for critical care support, and spatial gaps in land and airborne rescues that worsened during inclement weather and sea swells. Mean paired differences (slowest-fastest) in ambulance rescue times to the District Hospital for both islands and barangays were significant (P<0.0001). Spatial care path analysis showed where point-of-care cardiac troponin testing should be implemented for expedited care of acute myocardial infarction. Geospatial strengths comprised distributed primary care that can be facilitated by point-of-care testing, logical interisland transfers for which decision making and triage could be accelerated with onboard diagnostics, and healthcare networks amenable to medical advances in prehospital testing that accelerate treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Point-of-care testing should be positioned upstream close to homes and island populations that have prolonged rescue time contours. Geospatially optimized point-of-need diagnostics and distributed prehospital testing have high potential to improve outcomes. These improvements will potentially decrease disparities in mortality among archipelago versus urban dwellers, help improve island public health, and enhance resilience for increasingly adverse and frequent climate change weather disasters that impact vulnerable coastal areas.

N2  - Background: Youth with CF attend a number of medical appointments each year, and many experience distress related to their medical care. 55% of children with CF report experiencing a potentially traumatic medical experience related to their CF care [1]. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has identified reducing procedural anxiety and distress by developing and implementing effective, CF-tailored interventions as a research priority. Our team explored how social stories could help meet the goal of reducing patient distress during routine CF medical care. Social stories are short stories that depict and explain a situation, teach appropriate behaviors, and are often tailored to the child's specific needs [2]. Historically, social stories have been used as an intervention for children with autism or other disabilities, but they have recently been adapted to promote positive adjustment for all children [2]. Social stories help children feel more prepared by setting expectations and teaching adaptive behavioral and emotional coping skills. In the medical setting, social stories can educate children about what to expect during routine CF-appointments, procedures, and treatments, which can ultimately reduce and prevent distress, anxiety, and medical traumatic stress. Method(s): Our interdisciplinary team (pediatric psychology, child life, nurse and physician CF team members), created a social story template depicting a stuffed animal going through CF appointments, including checking in at registration, getting vitals taken, taking x-rays, meeting with interdisciplinary CF team members, having blood drawn, and taking throat swabs. Social stories were paired with a matching stuffed animal and medical play supplies to promote engagement. Templates were created such that they could be personalized to include coping strategies discussed during psychotherapy appointments with our pediatric psychology team to meet individual patients' needs. For example, if a patient struggles with blood draws, the story can include tips for coping during needle sticks (Figure 1). Caregivers were encouraged to read these social stories with their child to prepare for CF appointments and encourage their child to role-play specific procedures with their stuffed animal to increase familiarity and comfort. Children were encouraged to bring their story and stuffed animal to CF medical appointments and review what is next as they progress through the visit.We piloted these social stories with several youth with CF. Result(s): We will present two case examples of how we implemented these social stories, including successes; challenges; and patient, family, and provider perspectives on effectiveness. Conclusion(s): This pilot work indicates that social stories are a promising avenue to explore as a potential intervention to support children experiencing distress related to their CF medical care. More research examining feasibility and effectiveness in reducing anxiety and medical traumatic stress in necessary.

N2  - Background: The objective of this study is to describe the initial phase of an implementation trial to disseminate cystic fibrosis-cognitive behavioral therapy (CF-CBT) across CF centers. CF-CBT is an eight-session telehealth CF-specific cognitive-behavioral program developed in partnership with the CF community to promote resilience and treat depression and anxiety in adults with CF.We present data on the effectiveness and acceptability of CF-CBT training and baseline characteristics of CF providers and centers participating in implementation. Method(s): We conducted an 8-hour in-person CF-CBT training at the 2022 North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference. Attendees (n = 66) completed pre-post assessments of knowledge and comfort level with delivery of CFCBT principles and skills and training acceptability. The nonparametric signed rank test was used to compare pre-post assessments, and descriptive statistics were used to summarize acceptability ratings. CFCBT- trained health care providers (n = 34) who enrolled in the implementation trial completed a baseline survey on their roles and experience providing psychological interventions to persons with CF. Next, these trained providers were randomized to one of two consultation models of post-training implementation support. Baseline survey data are summarized with descriptive statistics. Result(s): All attendees completing post-training assessments (n = 59) indicated that they got what they wanted out of participating, their overall confidence in being able to administer CF-CBT improved, and it was likely they would use CF-CBT in their practice, and 96.7% endorsed being very or extremely satisfied with the training. On 5-point scales self-assessing five general and 11 module-specific CBT delivery skills before and after training, mean knowledge and comfort improved significantly overall (from 2.9 to 4.1 for knowledge, p < 0.001; from 3.7 to 4.3, p < 0.001 for comfort) and for all individual skills (Table 1). Thirty-four health-care providers from 33 centers enrolled in the implementation trial (33 female). None of the participating providers identified as Hispanic, 27 as white, three as Black, two as Asian/Pacific Islander, and one as bi- or multiracial; four identified as LGBTQ+. Three were able to provide care in a language other than English. There were 28 social workers, two psychologists, two pulmonologists or other non-psychiatrist physicians, one nurse practitioner, and one licensed professional counselor. Mean years of experience in CF care was 5.20 + 5.32. Experience using psychological interventions varied, with 58.8% having quite a bit or a lot of experience and 41.2% having little to none; 44.1% were experienced with CBT, and 55.9% had little to no CBT experience. Conclusion(s): Initial results demonstrated the effectiveness and acceptability of in-person CF-CBT training. Ongoing consultation will be offered to provide support to those with less experience with psychological interventions or CBT. A live virtual training followed by opportunity for consultation will be offered in early 2024. The ongoing trial will identify best practices to optimize implementation and reach across CF centers, providing a replicable implementation model to increase access to an empirically supported mental health intervention for adults with CF.

N2  - Background: Healthy siblings of individuals with CF experience elevated psychological symptoms, poor social adjustment, and fractious familial relationships [1,2]. Evidence supports the effectiveness of sibling-specific psychological interventions for families with chronic health conditions [3]. Internet-delivered methods of service delivery are appealing because they eliminate traditional barriers to accessing care. There are no tailored programs for healthy siblings of children with CF. The purpose of the current study was to obtain feedback on the acceptability and utility of the newly developed Internet-delivered Cystic Fibrosis Mental Health Prevention, Wellness, and Resource (iCF-PWR) program for healthy siblings of children with CF. Method(s): The iCF-PWR is a cognitive-behavioral psychoeducational program comprising five modules: What is CF?; How to stay healthy with CF. How does CF affect me? Feelings, physical sensations, thoughts, and behaviors. Coping strategies. Data collection is ongoing. Participants include four child siblings (mean age 10.2) and their parents (mean age 42.5) and five health care providers (mean age 48.40 recruited from CF clinics in Saskatchewan, Canada. Parent/child dyads and health care providers were provided access to the iCF-PWR, reviewed the program, and rated components of each module on a 7-point scale (1 = poor to 7 = very good) for relevance, usability, quality, clarity, and potential effectiveness. Participants also answered open-ended questions about the strengths and weaknesses of the iCF-PWR. Result(s): Preliminary results demonstrate that, for parent/child dyads, mean ratings for iCF-PWR components across modules ranged from 5.67 to 7.00. For health care providers, mean ratings for each iCF-PWR component across modules ranged from 5.80 to 7.00. The acceptability criterion requiring 80% of evaluators to provide ratings of 5-7 for each iCF-PWR component was met. Minor changes were suggested by evaluators to increase clarity and functionality. Strengths identified by evaluators included detailed disease information, inclusion of stories from healthy siblings in families with CF, and the user-friendly nature of the program. Conclusion(s): Ratings for the iCF-PWR modules met acceptability criteria for each component for parent/child dyads and health care providers. After participant recruitment and analyses are complete, changes may be made to the iCF-PWR before evaluating the effectiveness of the program in addressing mental health symptoms, increasing disease knowledge, and improving coping skills. Integrating the iCF-PWR into CF clinic care will contribute to improve quality of life of healthy siblings of children with CF.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nurses are a crucial part of healthcare organisations, constituting around half of the global healthcare workforce. Therefore, it is important to examine the factors that may affect their job performance, which is central to the delivery of effective healthcare services. AIM: To examine the relationships between stress, resilience and job performance within the nursing context in Jordan. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional descriptive correlational design was used. A self-administered questionnaire comprising stress, resilience and job performance scales was completed by a convenience sample of 207 nurses working in five hospitals in the northern and middle regions of Jordan. RESULT(S): Overall, respondents self-reported moderate stress levels, normal resilience levels and moderate job performance. The study identified: a moderate positive correlation between stress and resilience; a weak negative correlation between stress and job performance; and a weak positive correlation between resilience and job performance. CONCLUSION(S): It is essential that nurse managers, leaders and policymakers implement measures to mitigate the stressors encountered by nurses, increase resilience and foster effective coping mechanisms. Such measures could enhance nurses' resilience and job performance, ultimately improving patient care.Copyright © 2023 RCN Publishing Company Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nurses often face ethical issues in their daily work that can have an impact on their level of job embeddedness. And positive job embeddedness is essential to reduce burnout among nurses and improve professional retention in the medical industry. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between moral distress, moral resilience, and job embeddedness. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the relationship between moral distress, moral resilience, and job embeddedness, and explore the mediating role of moral resilience between moral distress and job embeddedness among nurses. DESIGN: A quantitative, cross-sectional study. METHOD(S): Nurses from a number of tertiary general hospitals in central China were surveyed and assessed using the Moral Distress Scale, the Nurse Moral Resilience Scale, and the nurse job embeddedness Scale from February to March 2023. The study was conducted in line with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. ETHICAL CONSIDERATION: All study procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of Hunan Normal University (No. 2023-313). FINDINGS: Moral distress was positively correlated with moral resilience (beta = 0.525, p < 0.01) and negatively correlated job embeddedness (beta = -0.470, p < 0.01). Moral resilience partially mediated the relationship between moral distress with job embeddedness (beta = -0.087, p < 0.01). DISCUSSION: The findings reveal a relationship between moral distress, job embeddedness, and moral resilience among nurses. CONCLUSION(S): Moral distress and moral resilience are important correlates of job embeddedness in nurses. Interventions to reduce moral distress and increase moral resilience may have potential benefits for improving nurses' job embeddedness. It is recommended that clinical nursing administrators create a favorable ethical atmosphere, educate nurses about ethics, and increase nurses' moral resilience.

N2  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a toll on the well-being and quality of life (QoL) of healthcare professionals, especially nurses. Insomnia, a common consequence of the pandemic, adds to the physical and mental strain on healthcare workers. Aim(s): This study aimed to assess the impact of workplace yoga intervention on insomnia severity and QoL among female nursing and healthcare professionals during the pandemic. Method(s): A pre-post-interventional study was conducted among 173 nursing professionals working in a hospital setting. Baseline assessments collected age, body mass index (BMI), insomnia severity using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and QoL using the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF). A 6-week workplace yoga intervention was conducted by trained professionals, followed by posttest assessments. Result(s): Among 173 participants, 57 had insomnia. Participants without significant insomnia had higher QoL scores (P < 0.001). Following the yoga intervention, both subthreshold and moderate clinical insomnia groups experienced reduced insomnia severity (P < 0.001). Quality-of-life scores in the physical, psychological, and environmental domains improved significantly (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Workplace yoga intervention appears to be a promising approach to alleviate insomnia and enhance QoL among female nursing and healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementing tailored workplace yoga programs can play a crucial role in promoting the well-being and resilience of healthcare workers, contributing to a positive work environment and improved patient care outcomes.Copyright © 2023 Indian Journal of Psychiatry  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

N2  - Military action in eastern Ukraine [Anti-terrorist Operation (ATO)] has a signifi-cant impact on the psyche of combat participants and causes changes in the life activities and behaviour of the individuals concerned. The traumatic expe-rience gained during hostilities has a negative impact on the health of military personnel. According to psychiatrists' forecasts, in the best-case scenario, 20% of combatants in Ukraine will be diagnosed with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, which has already been given the name "ATO syndrome". Given this, there is now an urgent need for rehabilitation activities, and the new conditions of hybrid warfare require social service professionals to respond quickly to combatants' requests to organise and deliver comprehensive rehabilitation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyse the provision and conduct of psy-chological rehabilitation of combatants in Ukraine from 2014 to 2021. Philosophical and general scientific methods were employed to achieve the aim. Among the general scientific methods, the theoretical (analysis, generali-sation, classification, and synthesis) and empirical (description and compari-son) levels should be highlighted. Also, a bibliosemantic method was used to summarise the analysis of the subject literature and our own experimental data. In addition, various programs were employed to rehabilitate the military. For example, the "Cyber Defenders" project, which was launched in 2021. This in-volved 30 veterans who will receive a certificate in cybersecurity upon gradua-tion. The E-Veteran system, which allows veterans to seek psychological support, was also analyzed. As the main results, it is worth mentioning that psychological rehabilitation is a pool of psychophysiological, psychotherapeutic, organisational, and medical measures aimed at the resumption of lost mental functions and psychocorrection of the social status of military personnel who have suffered mental combat trauma. The study analysed the mental state and profile of servicemen and ser-vicewomen, the psychological and psychiatric problems that affected them, and government programmes and projects to support and assist ATO/JFO (Joint Forces Operation) veterans. Regarding the process of psychological rehabilitation for military personnel in Ukraine itself, positive trends can be observed since 2014, such as the opening of the Ministry of Veterans' Affairs, but in the light of current threats and challenges, these undertakings are still insufficient. The system of psychological assistance and rehabilitation of ATO participants should be considered a component of the national security of the state. The article is of practical value in a range of areas, including in political, social work, pedagogical, and educational fields, as well as having application in criminal justice and the law.Copyright © 2023, MEDSPORTPRESS Publishing House.

N2  - Background: While the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of immunization delivery systems globally, the devastating impact of the pandemic on immunization delivery is most pronounced in low and middle-income countries like Pakistan. We conducted a qualitative study to capture the views and experiences of parents and healthcare workers (HWs) and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on childhood routine immunization (CRI) and COVID-19 vaccination in Pakistan. Method(s): We used a qualitative research design with a purposive sampling approach. Semi-structured interviews (via telephone) and focus group discussions (via Zoom) were conducted with parents/child caregivers and HWs, respectively. All qualitative interviews were conducted between February and July 2021 from three sites (two urban and one rural) in Sindh, Pakistan. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded for a team-based thematic analysis. Result(s): Overall, most parents and HWs indicated a strong trust in the benefits of CRI; nonetheless, a substantial disruption in the delivery and uptake of these services was also reported. The barriers towards CRI included closed vaccination centers, drastic reduction in outreach programs, lack of information for parents/child caregivers on vaccine availability, fear in the community regarding vaccine safety, limited vaccine supply, and a lack of healthcare staff. For COVID-19 vaccines, challenges cited included skepticism about the reality of the pandemic and confusion over COVID-19 vaccines due to conflicting (or mis-or-dis) information. Both participant groups showed a willingness to integrate COVID-19 vaccination into Pakistan's Expanded Program for Immunization if required in the future. Conclusion(s): During the COVID-19 pandemic, disruptions of regular immunization delivery in Pakistan were not due to parental unwillingness to vaccinate, but rather to social and logistical challenges caused by a rapidly changing context and difficulties in providing vaccination services safely. Barriers to vaccine access and concerns about COVID-19 exposure during clinic visits also contributed to uncertainty regarding immunization services early in the pandemic. For catchup campaigns and future pandemics, more than focusing interventions on persuading people, strategic approaches to building resilience through system-based interventions, such as investing in surge capacity in the immunization workforce to bounce back quickly after the first shock are required.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Health-care professionals are confronted with patients who wish to end their lives through voluntarily stopping eating and drinking (VSED). During VSED, symptoms such as agitation, thirst or psychological distress may arise, thus making close medical accompaniment necessary. Dealing with these symptoms can put a high burden on palliative care teams. Furthermore, divergent perceptions of the ethical classification of VSED may lead to moral distress. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of experience gained over time on the burden of palliative care professionals while accompanying patients during VSED and to assess the perceptions of coping strategies. Method(s): This is a prospective single-centre study conducted at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Palliative Care at University Hospital Duesseldorf, Germany. At two points in time (T1, T2) one year apart, team members of all professions who were actively involved in the accompaniment were eligible to complete a pretested questionnaire. Result(s): Team members perceived the symptom complex of psychological distress, anxiety, and agitation to be the most burdensome symptoms for the patients (T1: 28/49, 57.1%; T2: 33/59, 55.9%). Thirst was the second most observed symptom (T1: 17/49, 34.7%, T2: 19/59, 32.2%). These were also the most burdensome symptoms for individual team members. Most team members found there were no general moral concerns. There was a decrease in the perceived importance of support strategies such as ethical counselling (85.7% versus 63.6%). Conclusion(s): Accompanying patients during VSED is a challenge for health-care professionals. When comparing T2 to T1, less emphasis lies on the importance of ethical counselling or psychiatric assessment to build a foundation for the accompaniment. Moral and ethical concerns seem to play a minor role. More in-depth studies covering a bigger sample size as well as qualitative studies are needed.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Mental health outcomes in nurses have historically indicated a greater prevalence of anxiety, depression, and suicide than the general population. It is vital to provide programming for healthcare workers to gain the necessary skills to reduce burnout and improve their mental and physical health. AIMS: The aims of this study were to evaluate mental health outcomes and healthy lifestyle beliefs and behaviors among nurses and other hospital employees who completed MINDBODYSTRONG, a cognitive-behavioral skill building program. METHOD(S): A pre-experimental, pre- and poststudy design was used to examine mental health and well-being outcomes among 100 hospital personnel who participated in MINDBODYSTRONG, a program designed to improve coping and resiliency and decrease stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Outcomes measured included healthy lifestyle behaviors, healthy lifestyle beliefs, anxiety, depression, stress, and burnout. RESULT(S): One hundred hospital personnel, including 93 nurses, completed the pre- and post-survey. Among all participants, post- MINDBODYSTRONG scores for healthy lifestyle beliefs (p=.00; Cohen's d=0.52) and healthy lifestyle behaviors (p=.00; Cohen's d=-0.74) increased significantly with medium effects, while depression (p=.00; Cohen's d=-0.51), anxiety (p=.00; Cohen's d=-0.54), stress (p=.00; Cohen's d=-0.33), and burnout (p=.00; Cohen's d=-0.37) decreased significantly with small and medium effects. The program produced even stronger positive effects on mental health outcomes for participants who started the study with higher levels of depression and anxiety. LINKING EVIDENCE TO PRACTICE: Anxiety, depression, stress, and burnout decreased significantly postintervention. Participants also significantly improved their healthy lifestyle beliefs and behaviors with the MINDBODYSTRONG program. MINDBODYSTRONG is an effective program that reduces anxiety, depression, burnout, and stress and improves healthy lifestyle beliefs and behaviors in hospital-based clinicians. It is of utmost importance to provide evidence-based programs to improve mental resiliency and decrease stress, anxiety, burnout, and depressive symptoms, which will ultimately improve the safety and quality of health care.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Background & Introduction: At least one in every eight children in the United States live with a parent diagnosed with a substance use disorder (SUD; Hunt, Slack, & Berger, 2017), while one in 5 children live with a parent who misuses substances (Kulig, 2005). Children living in these homes experience higher rates than peers of abuse and neglect, parental separation, and housing instability (National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare, 2019; Peisch et al., 2018). This risk extends to development of educational delays, behavior health disorders, and SUDs. Evidence suggests similar outcomes for children living with a parent misusing substances. Thus, behavioral health programming should target families with either form of problematic substance use. However, holistic family treatment is uncommon outside SUD residential treatment, mandated outpatient services or adolescent substance treatment settings services available for many of these children is lacking. To address this gap in services, the Family Oriented Resilience, Growth and Empowerment (FORGE) program was developed at a safety net hospital with a large adult SUD treatment program. We describe the development of a responsive consultation, referral, and service model, including recruitment methods and services provided. We will also present service utilization information for families enrolled in the program. Method(s): In August 2019, the FORGE program launched to identify and treat children ages zero to 17 affected by familial substance use. The FORGE program provided individual, family, and group interventions. FORGE utilized a "no-wrong-door" approach, where families could access care from any clinic in the healthcare system. FORGE inclusion criteria included endorsed past or present parental substance misuse. We also included families with history of intimate partner violence (IPV), homelessness/housing instability, and/or parental incarceration, as parental SUDs are often undisclosed and these experiences served as a proxy of parental SUDs. We included families who started the program between August 2019 and March 2020. Demographic information included child age, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, insurance status, and child's primary language. We collected clinically relevant data as available, including referral source, substance(s) used by parents, child diagnosis, social services involvement, and removal from parent's care. To capture treatment engagement, we recorded three metrics, 1) if the family scheduled a first appointment, 2) if the family attended a first appointment, consult, or intake, and 3) if the family attended any treatment sessions and the number of sessions attended over a two-year period. We characterized our sample using descriptive statistics in R. Result(s): One hundred and twenty-seven children, from 118 families, were referred to the program. Children in the program were ethnically/racially diverse; WhiteHispanic (41.9%), White Non-Hispanic (24.6%), and Black/African-American (12.7%). Families were predominantly publicly insured (91.6%). Children ranged in age from 4 months to 17 years (M(SD) = 9.11(5.16)) and were 52% female. Families were most often referred from Denver Health's substance use treatment clinics (43%) and pediatric primary care clinic (27.56%). At initial referral, eighty nine percent of families reported at least one biological parent with substance misuse history. Opioid misuse was reported most (44.88%), followed by alcohol (27.56%) and methamphetamines (18.11%). Families reported high historical rates of IPV (67.19%), homelessness (52.34%), and parental incarceration (57.03%). On average, children in our sample experienced 2.48 (SD = 1.28) of these risk factors for later substance misuse. Of the children who completed an intake, trauma and stressor related disorders were the most common diagnoses assigned. Over two-thirds of the children had past social services involvement, with 32.81% of children referred during an active DHS case. Almost forty percent of children had been removed from their biological parents' custody in their lifetime. Over two-thirds of the 127 children referred completed an initial consult or a full intake with FORGE staff. Of these 90 children, fifty-seven attended at least one session of therapy (63.33% follow through, 44.88% of total sample). Children attended anywhere from one to 59 therapy sessions, with a median of seven sessions completed. Conclusion & Discussion: From our search, the FORGE program is the first integrated outpatient program for children of all ages affected by parental substance misuse in the nation. Program eligibility criteria were largely successful in identifying families with parental substance misuse through proximal experiences. Overlap of parental substance misuse with other adverse childhood experiences was quite high, suggesting a need to account for and address these experiences in design of service and intervention approaches. Successful program implementation in a safety-net hospital suggests generalizability to other under-resourced settings working with disadvantaged and stigmatized populations. Limitations of this study are inherent to retrospective chart review, including missing data on child and family characteristics not included in standard referral processes. As this project focused on program building, we did not have outcome measurement or a clear definition of treatment success, limiting our ability to state program effectiveness beyond session attendance. The FORGE program has grown in the last two years. We implemented routine outcome monitoring, identified useful empirically standard treatments (i.e. Alternatives for Families Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Parent Child Interaction Training), and embedded behavioral health services in other areas of our hospital to increase support for families seeking care.

N2  - Latin America and the Caribbean was one of the regions hardest hit globally by SARS-CoV-2. This qualitative exploratory study examined how the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the delivery of routine health services from the perspective of health care system decision makers and managers. Between May and December 2022, we conducted forty-two semistructured interviews with decision makers from ministries of health and health care managers with responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic in eight countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. On the basis of these interviews, we identified themes in three domains: impacts on the provision of routine health services, including postponed and forgone primary care and hospital services; barriers to maintaining routine health services due to preexisting structural health care system weaknesses and difficulties attributed to the pandemic; and innovative strategies to sustain and recover services such as public-private financing and coordination, telemedicine, and new roles for primary care. In the short term, policy efforts should focus on recovering postponed services, including those for noncommunicable diseases. Medium-and long-term health care system reforms should strengthen primary care and address structural issues, such as fragmentation, to promote more resilient health care systems.Copyright © 2023, Project HOPE.

N2  - Primary health care (PHC) is the most effective way to improve people's health and well-being, and primary care services should act as the cornerstone of a resilient health system and the foundation of universal health coverage. To promote high quality development of PHC, an International Symposium on Quality Primary Health Care Development was held on December 4-5, 2023 in Beijing, China, and the participants have proposed and advocated the Beijing Initiative on Quality Primary Health Care Development. The Beijing Initiative calls on all countries to carry out and strengthen 11 actions: fulfill political commitment and accountability; achieve "health in all policies" through multisectoral coordination; establish sustainable financing; empower communities and individuals; provide community-based integrated care; promote the connection and integration of health services and social services through good governance; enhance training, allocation and motivation of health workforce, and medical education; expand application of traditional and alternative medicine for disease prevention and illness healing; empower PHC with digital technology; ensure access to medicinal products and appropriate technologies; and last, strengthen global partnership and international health cooperation. The Initiative will enrich the content of quality development of PHC, build consensus, and put forward policies for quality development of PHC in China in the new era, which are expected to make contributions in accelerating global actions.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - This qualitative systematic review aims to comprehensively understand the experiences and perspectives of nurses infected with COVID-19, addressing a significant gap in the current literature. Following the JBI meta-synthesis approach, a rigorous search was conducted across nine electronic databases and references until January 16, 2023. Seventeen eligible studies underwent quality assessment using the JBI critical checklist. Data were synthesized using standardized tools, and the ConQual tool evaluated confidence in the findings. Seven key findings emerged, providing valuable insights into emotional experiences, adaptation to COVID-19 challenges, influence of support systems, coping strategies, posttraumatic growth perceptions, and effects on professional identity and career advancement. The findings highlight emotional toll, adaptive strategies, and professional implications for nurses. Moreover, they emphasize the importance of support systems, coping mechanisms, and posttraumatic growth in promoting nurses' well-being and resilience. These insights have practical implications for targeted interventions and support mechanisms to enhance infected nurses' well-being and improve healthcare outcomes.Copyright © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Despite abundant evidence demonstrating that improvements to health and education are positively correlated, and the importance of school-based platforms to achieve shared impacts, collaboration between ministries of health and education remains limited across low- and middle-income countries. Enhancing this collaboration is essential to realize mutually beneficial results, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted health and education outcomes globally and highlighted the importance of resilient, domestically funded systems for delivering key social services including primary health care and education. We argue that the lack of an effective joint financing mechanism has hindered adoption of collaborative multisectoral approaches such as the WHO/UNESCO's Health Promoting Schools (HPS) model. HPS is well-positioned to organize, finance, and deliver primary health care and education services through a school-based platform and strategy. Case studies from several low- and middle-income countries highlight the need to expand limited inter-ministerial collaborations to achieve cross-sectoral benefits and ensure sustainability of HPS beyond the lifecycle of external partners' support. It is important to identify ways to widen the resource envelope for sector-specific activities and create efficiencies through mutually beneficial outcomes. This paper offers two pragmatic solutions: an inter-ministerial joint financing mechanism that starts with alignment of budgets but matures into a formal system for pooling funds, or a fixed-term co-financing mechanism that uses donor contributions to catalyze inter-ministerial collaborations. Achieving sustainability in these initiatives would require engaging the ministries of health, education, and finance; developing a common administrative, financial, and monitoring mechanism; and securing long-term commitment from all concerned stakeholders.Copyright © 2023 Schiff, Jha, Walker and Gonzalez-Pier.

N2  - Background: The mental health impacts of climate change-related disasters are significant. However, access to mental health services is often limited by the availability of trained clinicians. Although building local community capability for the mental health response is often prioritised in policy settings, the lack of evidence-based programs is problematic. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of the Skills for Life Adjustment and Resilience programme (SOLAR) delivered by trained local community members following compound disasters (drought, wildfires, pandemic-related lockdowns) in Australia. Method(s): Thirty-six community members were trained to deliver the SOLAR programme, a skills-based, trauma informed, psychosocial programme. Sixty-six people with anxiety, depression and/or posttraumatic stress symptoms, and impairment were randomised into the SOLAR programme or a Self-Help condition. They were assessed pre, post and two months following the interventions. The SOLAR programme was delivered across five 1-hourly sessions (either face to face or virtually). Those in the Self-Help condition received weekly emails with self-help information including links to online educational videos. Result(s): Multigroup analyses indicated that participants in the SOLAR condition experienced significantly lower levels of anxiety and depression, and PTSD symptom severity between pre - and post-intervention (T1 to T2), relative to the Self-Help condition, while controlling for scores at intake. These differences were not statistically different at follow-up. The SOLAR programme was associated with large effect size improvements in posttraumatic stress symptoms over time. Conclusion(s): The SOLAR programme was effective in improving anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms over time. However, by follow-up the size of the effect was similar to an active self-help condition. Given the ongoing stressors in the community associated with compounding disasters it may be that booster sessions would have been useful to sustain programme impact.Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry identifier: ACTRN12621000283875..

N2  - Effective communication in end-of-life care for pediatric cancer patients is crucial. Yet, limited research focuses on the communication experiences of pediatric oncology nurses during this period. This study aims to investigate the communication experiences and needs of these nurses with children and their families during the end-of-life period. A qualitative study design with photo voice methodology was followed. The research was conducted with 16 pediatric oncology nurses working in the pediatric oncology wards of a university hospital between January and May 2023. Data were collected the "Characteristic Information Form", "Semi-Structured Interview Form", and photovoice methodology. Data were analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis. Most of the nurses are at the undergraduate level, and their working experience in pediatric oncology wards ranges from 4months to 17years. Seven main themes emerged: Optimistic Communication-Interaction, Mindfulness, Active Coping, Behavioral Actions, Death Uncertainty Dilemma, Interpersonal and Environmental Factors, and Discrepancy between Ideals and Reality. The study sheds light on the importance of pediatric oncology nurses' ideals versus realities upstream approach in communicating with end-of-life children and their families, empowering pediatric oncology nurses on the journey to ideal end-of-life care.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Refugees and immigrants have experienced heightened health inequities related to COVID-19. As community-embedded frontline health personnel, refugee and immigrant community health workers (riCHWs) played essential roles in the provision of informational, instrumental, and emotional support during the unprecedented first year of the pandemic. Despite the importance of this workforce, riCHWs are at high risk for burnout due to low recognition and demanding workloads. This was exacerbated as riCHWs navigated a new and uncertain health delivery landscape. We sought to glean insight into riCHWs' stressors, coping strategies and resources, and self-efficacy to identify ways to support their work and wellbeing. Using a narrative inquiry approach, we conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 11 riCHWs working in a midsized city in the midwestern United States. We generated three distinct yet interrelated themes: (1) Rapid and trustworthy information is key, (2) Creativity and perseverance are good ... structural support is better, and (3) Integrating riCHW expertise into health promotion programming and decision-making. Although riCHWs were deeply committed to enhancing community wellbeing, quickly shifting responsibilities in tandem with structural-level health inequities diminished their self-efficacy and mental health. riCHWs relied on work-based friends/colleagues for informational and emotional support to enhance their capacity to deliver services. Findings suggest increasing opportunities for peer support and idea-exchange, professional development, and integration of riCHW expertise in health promotion decision-making are effective strategies to enhance riCHWs' professional self-efficacy and personal wellbeing.

N2  - AIMS: The study aims to test the Turkish validity and reliability of the Rushton Moral Resilience Scale (RMRS) and examine the effect of moral resilience on moral distress. BACKGROUND: Moral distress is a phenomenon that negatively affects health workers, health institutions, and the person receiving care. In order to eliminate or minimize the negative effects of moral distress, it is necessary to increase the moral resilience of nurses. Moral resilience involves developing systems that support a culture of ethical practice in healthcare and aim to increase an individual's capacity to cope with moral challenges. METHOD(S): A methodological and descriptive-predictive study design was adopted. Sociodemographic Information Form, Measure of Moral Distress - Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP), and Rushton Moral Resilience Scale were used to collect data from the nurses. A total of 255 clinical nurses were recruited. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Hacettepe University's non-interventional ethics committee approved the study's protocol and informed consent was obtained from the participants. RESULT(S): The original four-factor structure of the scale was tested with confirmatory factor analysis, and the index values were evaluated and found at an acceptable level. The Cronbach Alpha coefficient of the scale was found to be 0.826. Moral resilience predicted moral distress total, intensity, and frequency levels. A moderate and weak relationship was found in the negative between all sub-dimensions of moral distress and moral resilience. CONCLUSION(S): The Rushton Moral Resilience Scale Turkish version showed good psychometric properties. Moral resilience has a reducing effect on moral distress. Young nurses who have less experience are at risk because they have lower moral resilience levels, while nurses working in intensive care units are at risk because of their high moral distress levels. A healthy workplace can be created by developing specific approaches to improve moral resilience in reducing the impact of moral distress in the healthcare environment.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences and emotions of individuals with depression and physical comorbidity within the context of psychoeducational group interventions led by primary care nurses in Catalunya (Spain). METHOD(S): A psychoeducational group intervention was conducted in the first semester of 2019 with 13 primary care teams (rural/urban) and 95 participants with depression and physical comorbidity. The qualitative research and phenomenological perspective were based on 13 field diaries and 7 semi-structured interviews carried out with the observer nurses. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. Codes were identified by segmenting the text into citations/verbatim accounts and emerging categories/subcategories by regrouping the codes. The results were triangulated among the researchers to identify and compare similarities and differences. RESULT(S): Four major themes were found: (a) gender differences; (b) coping strategies and changes observed during the intervention; (c) functions of the group as a therapeutic element; and (d) the nurses' perceptions of the group experience. Gender differences were identified in relation to experiences and emotions. CONCLUSION(S): As some patients acquired skills/behaviours during the intervention that helped them initiate changes and the nurses were satisfied with the intervention, it is important to include this information when planning effective interventions for patients with this profile.Copyright © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

N2  - Objective. This study aimed to investigate emergency nurses' disaster nursing ability and psychological resilience, validate the effectiveness of a training system for disaster nursing ability based on psychological resilience, and verify the relationship between psychological resilience and disaster nursing ability among emergency nurses. Methods. A training system was developed to enhance psychological resilience and disaster nursing ability. A multicenter, randomized controlled experiment was conducted in five Grade III hospitals in Sichuan Province. A total of 93 emergency nurses were randomly assigned to the following three groups: the blank group, intervention group, and control group. The corresponding interventions were as follows: no intervention, psychological resilience, and nurses' disaster nursing ability training. Personal information forms, the Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale, and the Nurses' Disaster Nursing Ability Assessment Scale were used in the survey. Results. There was no significant difference in the scores of psychological resilience and disaster nursing ability in the blank group in the pretest and posttest (P>0.05). The disaster nursing ability of both the intervention and control groups significantly improved in the posttest (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the intervention group demonstrated significant improvement in psychological resilience in the posttest (P<0.05). However, there was no statistical difference in psychological resilience scores in the control group in the pretest and posttest (P>0.05). Conclusion. The study concluded that the psychological resilience and disaster nursing ability of emergency nurses could be enhanced through the implemented training system.Copyright © 2023 Lin Lan et al.

N2  - Background: This study aimed to investigate the association between inclusion to Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), a CCT program in the Philippines, and malnutrition in children and adolescents and examine the perceptions and experiences of parents and other stakeholders on how 4Ps influenced child nutrition. Method(s): A concurrent mixed-method study was conducted in the Caraga Region, Philippines. Quantitative data from 5541 children and adolescents aged 3 to 19 were analyzed using multilevel mixed-effect logistic models. To allow in-depth understanding of the programmatic components that support the findings from the quantitative study, eight focused group discussions (FGDs) were concurrently conducted, cumulating 33 participants, including 4Ps parents, school coordinators/teachers, and school nurses. A constructivist grounded theory approach was used for analysis, and joint displays were employed to integrate quantitative and qualitative results. Result(s): Quantitative findings revealed high rates of malnutrition, with significant rates of stunting (12.0%), wasting/thinness (9.4%), and overweight/obesity (16.4%) among children and adolescents. 4Ps beneficiaries had higher odds of stunting and overweight/obesity compared to non-4Ps beneficiaries (AOR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.08-1.91; AOR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.01-1.45, respectively). However, no significant association was observed between inclusion to 4Ps and concurrent stunting and wasting/thinness or overweight/obesity (AOR = 1.05, 95%CI: 0.72-1.55). Geographic variations were observed, with 4Ps children in Agusan del Sur having lower odds of stunting than those in Agusan del Norte (AOR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.23-0.71). Age and gender also showed significant associations with malnutrition. The qualitative analysis provided insights into the challenges contributing to malnutrition, including child labor, sickness, long distances to school, limited access to healthy food, and larger families. Unintended consequences such as cash card mismanagement, inappropriate cash grant allocation, and falsification of school attendance were identified. However, teachers and parents demonstrated resilience by implementing adaptive approaches to enhance child nutrition. Conclusion(s): While 4Ps beneficiaries exhibit higher odds of stunting and overweight/obesity, the program's association with malnutrition was significantly influenced by geographic variations. It is crucial for social protection programs to prioritize comprehensive support strategies that effectively counter unintended consequences and challenges faced by beneficiaries and other stakeholders and address malnutrition in children and adolescents.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Suicide is a pressing matter for the military. Not only does it pose a health risk, but suicide also compromises operational readiness. Despite provision of suicide prevention clinical best practices, the Department of Defense suffers several challenges (e.g., clinician shortages) limiting the agency's ability to effectively respond to service member suicide. Implementation of evidence-based suicide-specific group therapy is a possible solution to service member well-being needs and system challenges. Service members can also gain coping skills useful beyond managing suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Method(s): This 2-arm non-inferiority randomized controlled trial compares a group therapy format of Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (i.e., G-BCBT) with Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Skills Group. Both therapies are delivered in-person at a United States Naval Medical Center. Participants (N = 136) are active-duty service members with recent suicidal thoughts or suicidal behavior. Evaluation features electronically delivered questionnaires at baseline, after each treatment session, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Discussion(s): The primary outcome concerns G-BCBT impacts on suicidal ideation. Secondary outcomes of interest are suicide attempt, psychological distress (e.g., symptoms of depression, anxiety), and self-regulatory skills (e.g., emotion regulation). We also examine self-regulatory skills as treatment moderators. Clinical trial strengths and limitations are reviewed.

N2  - Resilience has been reported to attenuate psychological burden and promote mental health. Military personnel constitute a population with a high psychological burden and poor sleep quality and are thus at a high risk of depression. This study is aim to examine the mechanism underlying the effects of resilience on perceived stress, sleep quality, and depression among Taiwanese army military personnel. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 2020 and February 2021. Participants comprised 1505 voluntary army military service personnel aged 20 years or older; they completed self-reported questionnaires measuring their perceived stress, resilience, sleep quality, and depression. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling. The results indicated that the association between resilience and depression was partially mediated by perceived stress and sleep quality. Perceived stress is a significant mediator on the association between resilience and depression. A high level of sleep disturbance was observed in this population and results found that sleep quality showed a slight partial mediation effect on the association between resilience and depression. Resilience can alleviate the effects of stress, which in turn alleviates depression among military personnel. Promoting resilience-enhancing education and mitigating environmental barriers to sleep is essential for reducing depressive symptoms among military personnel.Copyright © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - After a cardiovascular event, patients and their families often have to cope with numerous changes in their lives, including the consequences of the disease or its treatment on their daily lives and functioning. Coping poorly with both physical and psychological challenges may lead to an impaired quality of life. Sexuality is one aspect of the quality of life that is important for many patients and partners that may be adversely affected by a cardiac event. The World Health Organization defines sexual health as "...a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of dis-ease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences ..." The key points can be summarized as follows: 1) Safe timing of a return to sexual activity after a cardiac event, as it has been addressed by the American Heart Association, and decreased sexual activity among cardiac patients is frequently reported. 2) Rates of erectile dysfunction (ED) among men with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are twice as high as in the general population. 3) ED and vaginal dryness may appear 1-3 years after the onset of angina pectoris, however only a small percentage of those with sexual dysfunction seek medical care. 4) Routine assessment of sexual problems and sexual counseling should, therefore, be a part of effective management by physicians, nurses, and other health-care providers.Copyright © 2014, Care Comm s.r.o.

N2  - No standard tool to measure pathologist workload currently exists. An accurate measure of workload is needed for determining the number of pathologists to be hired, distributing the workload fairly among pathologists, and assessing the overall cost of pathology consults. Initially, simple tools such as counting cases or slides were used to give an estimate of the workload. More recently, multiple workload models, including relative value units (RVUs), the Royal College of Pathologists (RCP) point system, Level 4 Equivalent (L4E), Work2Quality (W2Q), and the University of Washington, Seattle (UW) slide count method, have been developed. There is no "ideal" model that is universally accepted. The main differences among the models come from the weights assigned to different specimen types, differential calculations for organs, and the capture of additional tasks needed for safe and timely patient care. Academic centers tend to see more complex cases that require extensive sampling and additional testing, while community-based and private laboratories deal more with biopsies. Additionally, some systems do not account for teaching, participation in multidisciplinary rounds, quality assurance activities, and medical oversight. A successful workload model needs to be continually updated to reflect the current state of practice. Awareness about physician burnout has gained attention in recent years and has been added to the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (World Health Organization, WHO) as an occupational phenomenon. However, the extent to which this affects pathologists is not well understood. According to the WHO, burnout syndrome is diagnosed by the presence of three components: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization from one's work (cynicism related to one's job), and a low sense of personal achievement or accomplishment. Three drivers of burnout are the demand for productivity, lack of recognition, and electronic health records. Prominent consequences of physician burnout are economic and personal costs to the public and to the providers. Wellness is physical and mental well-being that allows individuals to manage stress effectively and to thrive in both their professional and personal lives. To achieve wellness, it is necessary to understand the root causes of burnout, including over-work and working under stressful conditions. Wellness is more than the absence of stress or burnout, and the responsibility of wellness should be shared by pathologists themselves, their healthcare organization, and governing bodies. Each pathologist needs to take their own path to achieve wellness.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

T1  - Women's experience of post-traumatic growth following a traumatic birth: an interpretive phenomenological analysis

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background: Approximately 3-5% of women experience post-traumatic stress disorder following birth; positive experiences that can follow traumatic birth are under-researched. Aims and Objectives: To explore how women experience post-traumatic growth following a traumatic birth. Method(s): Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to explore experiences of women who self-identified as having found positive benefits through coping with a traumatic birth. Eight women who had birthed in the past five years in the UK were recruited online and interviewed face-to-face. Result(s): Three superordinate themes were developed: 'The total opposite to what I'd expected' (participants' struggle to understand and integrate their birth experience in the postnatal period); 'I see it a bit differently now' (processes experienced in coming to a place of growth); and 'A much better place' (experienced growth 'outcomes'). Discussion(s): Faced with shattered assumptions whereby their birth experiences contrasted with their expectations, participants felt their identities as women and mothers were challenged. In overcoming these challenges, participants described actively striving to cope and make sense of their experience. Multiple factors facilitated this, notably partner support, telling their birth story, acknowledging the impact and developing a compassionate narrative. Although growth was experienced in ways commonly reported by survivors of challenging life events, some aspects appeared pertinent to birth trauma. Conclusion(s): Widening our understanding of the range of experiences following traumatic birth and making these narratives public may offer hope for some women and families and inform health professionals' education and practice. Further research would be needed before advocating interventions to foster post-traumatic growth.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Studies suggest that a three-session brief treatment program (Brief Relaxation, Education, and Trauma Healing [BREATHE]) can help treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and symptoms of trauma; however, the program has not been examined via telehealth. Thus, the current study evaluated the feasibility of BREATHE delivered via telehealth. The intervention included breathing retraining and psychoeducation about PTSD and trauma. Thirty participants from the community with confirmed PTSD diagnoses participated in this telehealth program. Treatment retention was high, and participants showed decreased PTSD symptoms, posttraumatic cognitions, depression, anxiety, overall psychiatric symptoms, and internalized stigma and increased resiliency at posttreatment and 3-month follow up. Results suggest that a telehealth brief treatment program for PTSD is feasible and effective for individuals with PTSD. [Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services, xx(x), xx-xx.].

N2  - Objectives To explore the experiences of clinical leads in paediatric critical care units (PCCUs) in England and Wales during the reorganisation of services in the initial surge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to learn lessons for future surges and service planning. Methods A qualitative study design using semistructured interviews via virtual conferencing was conducted with consultant clinical leads and lead nurses covering 21 PCCUs. Interviews were conducted over a period of 2 weeks, 2 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 surge. Interview notes underwent thematic analysis. Results Thematic analysis revealed six themes: leadership, management and planning; communication; workforce development and training; innovation; workforce experience; and infection prevention and control. Leadership was facilitated through clinician-led local autonomy for decision-making and services were better delivered when the workforce was empowered to be flexible in their response. Communication was preferred through collaborative management structures. Further lessons include recognising workforce competencies in surge preparations, the use of virtual technology in facilitating training and meetings, the importance of supporting the well-being of the workforce and the secondary consequences of personal protective equipment use. Conclusions During the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an agile response to a rapidly changing situation was enabled through effective clinical leadership and an adaptive workforce. Open systems of communication across senior clinical and management teams facilitated service planning. Support for all members of the workforce through implementation of appropriate and innovative education and well-being solutions was vital in sustaining resilience. This learning supports planning for future surge capacity across paediatric critical care locally and nationally.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

N2  - WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Storytelling is an effective tool for communication, is universally comprehensible and transcends linguistic barriers, adapting to cultures easily. Storytelling has a strong influence on children and has been used for knowledge retention and for developing imagination, creativity and prosocial behaviours. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: The systematic review offers essential insights into the effects of storytelling interventions on the development of resilience in children. It indicates the various forms of storytelling interventions implemented and also the specific measures of resilience employed in the studies. The review has demonstrated that storytelling plays a crucial role in the development of protective factors in children including resilience. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Psychiatric and mental health nurses working in community, hospital or mental health units play an important role in mental health interventions, particularly when it comes to children and young adults. Employing storytelling techniques can help psychiatric and mental health nurses provide timely and consistent support to children while helping them explore support systems, mechanisms and coping strategies helping build resilience. This holds particular importance for low- and middle-income countries where limited resources pose challenges in providing adequate support for mental health programmes for children. Methods such as storytelling are simple and adaptable to the specific challenges faced in the mental health setting. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Resilience is a crucial aspect of mental health and coping that enables individuals to effectively recover from challenges. Fostering resilience in children becomes a significant objective. Storytelling is known to positively affect resilience, providing opportunities to share and develop narratives that help make sense of difficult experiences, find meaning in them, and building beliefs around our capacity to adapt well to challenging experiences. AIM: The aim of this review is to synthesize peer-reviewed studies on the impact of storytelling interventions in developing resilience in children. METHOD(S): The review adhered to the updated PRISMA 2020 guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022365474). We conducted searches in 12 databases with search strings comprising of concepts regarding storytelling, resilience and children. RESULT(S): The review included 11 studies published between 2012 and 2022. The narrative synthesis of the studies indicates that storytelling interventions enhanced psychological resilience in children. DISCUSSION: Storytelling-based interventions in school settings with participatory approaches using cultural stories, and positive psychology-based interventions were effective and feasible. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This review has scope for informing future interventions with children, especially those who live in marginalized communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory therapists (RTs) work alongside allied health staff, nurses, and physicians during stressful and traumatic events that can be associated with emotional and physiological implications known as second victim (SV) experiences (SVEs). This study aimed to evaluate SVEs of RTs, including both positive and negative implications. METHOD(S): RTs within a large academic health care organization across Minnesota, Wisconsin, Florida, and Arizona were asked to participate in an anonymous survey that included the validated Second Victim Experience and Support Tool-Revised to assess SVEs as well as desired support services. RESULT(S): Of the RTs invited to participate, 30.8% (171/555) completed the survey. Of the 171 survey respondents, 91.2% (156) reported that they had been part of a stressful or traumatic work-related event as an RT, student, or department support staff member. Emotional or physiologic implications experienced by respondents as SVs included anxiety 39.1% (61/156), reliving of the event 36.5% (57/156), sleeplessness 32.1% (50/156), and guilt 28.2% (44/156). Following a stressful clinical event, 14.8% (22/149) experienced psychological distress, 14.2% (21/148) experienced physical distress, 17.7% (26/147) indicated lack of institutional support, and 15.6% (23/147) indicated turnover intentions. Enhanced resilience and growth were reported by 9.5% (14/147). Clinical and non-clinical events were reported as possible triggers for SVEs. Nearly half of respondents 49.4% (77/156) indicated feeling like an SV due to events related to COVID-19. Peer support was the highest ranked form of desired support following an SVE by 57.7% (90/156). CONCLUSION(S): RTs are involved in stressful or traumatic clinical events, resulting in psychological/physical distress and turnover intentions. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on RTs' SVEs, highlighting the importance of addressing the SV phenomenon among this population.Copyright © 2023 Daedalus Enterprises.

N2  - Aim: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are especially vulnerable to the pandemic due to their need for routine and difficulty in adapting to change. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychosocial impact of the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on children diagnosed with ASD and their families and the challenges they faced during this period. Material(s) and Method(s): We surveyed 85 parents of children with ASD aged 3-18 years, who were followed up in our clinic between the years of 2020 and 2021. We assessed ASD families' pandemic impact with the "Child and Adolescent Reactions to Stressful Situations-Autism Family Adaptation and Resilience" items. Parents answered the questionnaire online or by phone. Result(s): The mean age of the children was 10.3+/-4.1 years, 65 were boys and 20 were girls. 10.6% of the families had a medical emergency during the pandemic. The most common behavioral problems were anger, difficulty in concentrating, and hyperactivity. 37.6% of the children could not receive educational support, 74.1% could not receive treatment, 31.1% had difficulty in reaching a doctor, and 7.8% had difficulty in affording treatment. Furthermore, 33% of the children spent more than 4 hours a day on screens. 61.2% of parents rated the pandemic quarantine process as more difficult than before. Conclusion(s): The pandemic disrupted the daily routines, special education, rehabilitation, and health care services of children with ASD. It also increased their behavioral problems. Therefore, recognizing and addressing the psychological needs of children with special needs, such as ASD, will be an important part of the response to future disasters.Copyright © 2023 by Tekirdag Namik Kemal University.

N2  - Objective: Background: Case Report: Conclusion(s): Unusual setting of medical care Current medical technologies enable physicians to treat patients outside operating rooms using minimally invasive techniques. Non-operating room anesthesia (NORA) represents a growing field of medicine, with an increasing number of cases performed over the last decade. As a result, anesthesia providers will need to enhance their understanding of the resources, medical and paramedical staff, and environment outside the operating room. Patients undergoing such procedures under light conscious sedation still experience discomfort such as pain and anxiety, thus requiring the use of pain control medication or sedative drugs. At the same time, the use of hypnosis is spreading in medical practice, particularly with minimally invasive procedures. Many studies have investigated the use of hypnosis in cases of minimally invasive procedures, showing an effective reduction of patients' discomfort and consumption of pain control medication, thus improving patient safety. We describe the case of a woman in her 70s who underwent a thyroid nodule thermal ablation through high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) performed under hypnosis in a NORA setting. The procedure was well endured; the patient experienced comfort and was satisfied with having avoided general anesthesia. Post-HIFU follow-up showed a 30% decrease of thyroid nodule volume. The patient was completely satisfied with the esthetic result. The operator did not encounter any difficulties with the awoken patient or movements during the procedure. Our case confirms the effective role of hypnosis in relaxation and coping with painful procedures and high-lights patient satisfaction without the use of sedative drugs in the context of NORA procedures.Copyright © Am J Case Rep.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - The Life Course Health Development (LCHD) framework underscores the profound impact of stressors during critical developmental phases on an individual's lifelong health, including their mental well-being. Among these developmental transitions, adolescence emerges as a pivotal life stage where an adolescent's mental health trajectory is significantly influenced by the various risk and promotive factors embedded within their social ecosystem. Adolescents from adverse family environments (AFEs) face heightened susceptibility to mental health challenges. Nevertheless, there are opportunities within the adolescent's environment to foster resilience. In this paper, we employ an interdisciplinary approach grounded in the LCHD framework to assess existing research pertaining to resilience, social capital, and health development. Furthermore, we aim to provide actionable recommendations tailored to healthcare providers, with a specific emphasis on strategies to augment mental health outcomes among adolescent populations, particularly those experiencing AFEs.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Background and purpose: Enhancing hospitals' resilience is an essential step towards improving the ability of the system to deal with crisis and minimizing the consequences. Job satisfaction is an important factor in the nurses' turnover intention that can increase the quality of patient care. In this study, the level of hospital resilience and job satisfaction and the relationship between these two factors were investigated. Material(s) and Method(s): The present descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using a questionnaire to assess crisis management in hospitals based on Resilience Engineering approach and Job satisfaction Scale developed by Brayfield and Rothe. The participants included 184 nurses working at a hospital in Mazandaran province, 2021. Data analysis was done using SPSS V25 applying Pearson correlation and Spearman correlation, Bonferroni test, and simple linear regression. Result(s): There were 83% female participants and the average age was 36.36+/-6.66 years with 8.5+/-5.91 years of work experience. The average resilience score of the hospital was 2.685, indicating moderate levels of resilience. The highest to the lowest scores for the dimensions of resilience were associated with flexibility, management commitment, learning, and awareness. The resilience score showed a downward trend; ICU> operating room and internal ward> emergency unit. Also, the average score for job satisfaction was 59.066 which indicates a moderate level of job satisfaction. The correlation between organizational resilience and job satisfaction of employees was 0.312. Conclusion(s): The moderate level of organizational resilience and job satisfaction and the moderate correlation between these two variables require measurements to improve resilience and job satisfaction in order to effectively deal with crises and increase the quality of services.Copyright © 2023, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to assess occupational injuries among female orthopaedic surgeons and compare these rates to their male counterparts. Method(s): An electronic survey was developed to assess occupational injuries among female orthopaedic surgeons. Descriptive statistics were analyzed for all survey items, and chi-squared tests and paired t-tests were used when appropriate. Result(s): 169 female orthopaedic surgeons completed this survey, the average age was 50 years old. MSK Injuries: Among the 169 responding surgeons, there were a total of 320 work-related musculoskeletal injuries. Non-MSK Occupational Injuries: Female orthopaedic surgeons experience social isolation at much higher rates than their male counterparts (53.8 % and 32.9 % respectively, p < 0.0001) as well as psychological distress since beginning practice (61.5 % and 55.3 % respectively). Additionally, female orthopaedic surgeons report higher rates of burnout (72.2 %, p = 0.01) compared to male orthopaedic surgeons (63.4 %). Female orthopaedic surgeons also sought out counseling from mental health professionals at higher rates than their male counterparts since beginning training (37.3 % and 28.6 % respectively, p = 0.02). 13.1 % of female respondents reported having been diagnosed with cancer since starting practice. Additionally, 94.6 % of female orthopaedic surgeons have experienced a finger stick and 16.1 % of female orthopaedic surgeons have experienced hearing loss since beginning practice. Discussion(s): This study assesses the occupational injuries that affect female orthopaedic surgeons' physical and mental well-being. We found that in comparison to male orthopaedic surgeons, the major differences were found in the psychological and emotional domains. Women reported experiencing burnout and social isolation as well as seeking professional counseling at significantly higher rates than males; however, both genders reported concerningly high numbers. This could suggest that more resources need to be made available to help orthopaedic surgeons cope with the stresses of their demanding profession, with a specific emphasis on reducing work-related stress among female orthopaedic surgeons.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Background: Healthcare providers are engrossed in high-stakes, high-stress situations during their daily work with patient death being a potential negative outcome of work-related stress. Many interventions exist to combat work-related stress among nurses. The Pause, an intervention to offer a moment of silence for the healthcare team after a patient death, is one example. Objective(s): An integrative review of The Pause was conducted to investigate its use and how it impacts healthcare providers and their work environments. Method(s): The integrative review methodology by Whittemore and Knafl was used to guide this study. Steps included were problem identification, literature search, data evaluation, data analysis, and presentation. Content analysis was used to identify themes. Result(s): Seven databases were searched in 2022 and seven studies were identified for inclusion in this review. Two themes were identified: personal benefits and professional benefits. Findings reveal benefits from self-care and grief processing to a better work environment. Conclusion(s): The Pause is a low-cost, low-risk intervention that can be implemented at an organizational level to help reduce burnout, unresolved grief, increase resilience, increase retention, and improve patient outcomes. Future research should include an examination of how The Pause may affect patient outcomes and workplace culture.

N2  - Background: In clinical trials, RPM based on patient reported outcomes (PROs) has been shown to reduce symptom burden, increase dose intensity, improve quality of life and overall survival, and is recommended by international guidelines in routine oncology practice during systemic treatment (Di Maio et al., Ann Oncol 2022). Resilience developed a digital RPM system for oncology (CE marked, class IIa medical device) which prompts patients weekly with a notification to complete a survey including common symptoms from the NCI's PRO-CTCAE questionnaire. Severe or worsening symptoms trigger an alert notification to the patient's cancer care team, as well as personalized selfmanagement advice, empowerment and educational material to patients. In this study we report the real-world implementation of Resilience RPM system in France and Belgium. Method(s): Aggregated system-level metrics were collected covering all participating hospitals between Nov 2021 - Dec 2022. Qualitative and quantitative assessments focused on patient and provider utilization of Resilience RPM system was done. The implementation included a continued interaction between Resilience and hospital personnel for training, coordination and technical support. Result(s): 19 hospitals deployed Resilience in France and Belgium, including two Organization of European Cancer Institutes (OECI)- designated cancer centers and community oncology hospitals. Three integrated RPM with their electronic medical record. Overall, 1262 pts were registered (age range, 20-94), 40% with breast, 20% gastrointestinal and 8%genitourinary cancers. In the last 6 months, the main RPM interface was the mobile app (70%). Patient adherence with weekly RPM surveys was 85%, with a median time from prompt receipt to survey completion of 5h20min. RPM retention for 3 months, regardless of disease status, was 80%. Irrespective of severity, the most commonly reported PROs were performance status decline (94%), pain (89%) and anorexia (82%). The most common severe alert notifications were for nausea (33%), pain (31%) and anorexia (23%). The median time to alert management by the care team was 12h (70% within 24h), with 70% of alerts managed by a nurse navigator follow-up call, 5% by a referral for internal/external appointments, 0.5% with an emergency room referral and 0.4% with a hospitalization referral. 87% (32/38) of providers were satisfied with integrating the solution into their organization and 80% (30/38) felt patients were better managed through use of Resilience RPM. Conclusion(s): Implementation of the Resilience RPM system was feasible across a diverse group of 19 cancer centers in France and Belgium, with high levels of patient and provider participation and engagement. Resilience RPM offers an evidence-based approach to improve the quality and patientcenteredness of cancer care.

N2  - Climate change poses significant challenges to global mental health, with potential consequences including increased rates of suicide and mental health disorders. Early Career Psychiatrists (ECPs) play a crucial role in addressing these challenges. The Climate Psychiatry Alliance, a group of psychiatrists dedicated to improving mental health amidst climate change, recognizes the importance of cultivating climate-aware ECPs. Training ECPs to become confident climate-aware clinicians enables them to effectively treat patients experiencing anxiety, depression, and PTSD in the context of climate-related distress. Together with other mental health professionals, ECPs can contribute to efforts by implementing strategies for monitoring and treating mental health problems arising from climate events. Additionally, they can raise awareness about the psychological consequences and risks of suicide associated with climate change. Collaboration among ECPs from various regions is essential in developing community-based approaches and reducing vulnerabilities. ECPs must prioritize supporting vulnerable populations by advocating for increased funding for mental health support and research in affected areas. Long-term solutions to address the mental health impacts of climate change and global warming should be pursued to mitigate future suicidality. Integrating climate considerations into local mental health programs and expanding psychological support services is crucial. By promoting emotional resilience and self-awareness, ECPs can contribute to building a more climate-resilient and mentally healthy society.Copyright © 2023 Shoib, Hussaini, Armiya'u, Saeed, Ori, Roza, Gurcan, Agrawal, Solerdelcoll, Lucero-Prisno III, Nahidi, Swed, Ahmed and Chandradasa.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Burnout and attrition in nursing have been accelerated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nursing students experience greater stress than non-nursing students but often lack adequate institutional support to build resiliency. Support groups are an effective strategy for processing stress that are underused in nursing education. An innovative online stress impact course was developed at a college of nursing to address students' stress during the pandemic. The course culminated in a voluntary virtual support group led by a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner graduate student. The aim of this qualitative program evaluation was to determine how graduate nursing students experienced the stress support group. METHOD(S): This study used qualitative exploratory analysis of support group reflections from 47 graduate nursing students. RESULT(S): Four themes emerged: (1) Making Positive Connections; (2) Leveraging Skills to Manage Stress; (3) Beneficial; and (4) Facing Trauma. CONCLUSION(S): Graduate student-led support groups are a feasible and effective strategy to mitigate stress and improve nursing student resiliency. [J Nurs Educ. 2023;62(12):711-715.].

N2  - In today's digital landscape, securing multimedia visual information-specifically color images-is of critical importance across a range of sectors, including the burgeoning fields of logistics and supply chain management. Traditional Visual Cryptography (VC) schemes lay the groundwork for encrypting visual data by fragmenting a secret image into multiple shares, thereby ensuring no single share divulges the secret. Nevertheless, VC faces challenges in ascertaining the integrity of reconstructed images, especially when shares are manipulated maliciously. Existing solutions often necessitate additional shares or a trusted third party for integrity verification, thereby adding complexity and potential security risks. This paper introduces a novel Cheating-Resistant Visual Cryptographic Protocol (CRVC) for Color Images that aims to address these limitations. Utilizing self-computational models, this enhanced protocol simplifies the integrated integrity verification process, eliminating the need for extra shares. A standout feature is its capability to securely transmit meaningful shares for color images without compromising the quality of the reconstructed image as the PSNR maintains to be . Experimental findings substantiate the protocol's resilience against quality degradation and its effectiveness in verifying the authenticity of the reconstructed image. This innovative approach holds promise for a wide array of applications, notably in sectors requiring secure document transmission, such as Logistics and Supply Chain Management, E-Governance, Medical and Military Applications.

N2  - AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: (a) to examine the relationship between perceived organizational support and resilience; (b) to investigate the potential mediating role of general self-efficacy and cognitive reappraisal among emergency nurses who have experienced workplace violence; and (c) to explore the application of Kumpfer's resilience framework to emergency department nurses. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHOD(S): From February 17, 2021, to March 8, 2021, 825 emergency nurses working in the emergency departments of tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China, completed an online survey. Data on resilience, organizational support, cognitive reappraisal and general self-efficacy were collected through questionnaires. The Spearman analysis was employed to investigate the relationship between variables, while the mediation analysis was conducted using AMOS 23.0 statistical software. RESULT(S): The findings of a study involving 825 emergency nurses who reported experiencing workplace violence reveal a positive correlation between perceived organizational support and resilience. Additionally, it has been observed that the relationship between these two factors is mediated by both cognitive reappraisal and general self-efficacy. Furthermore, the mediating effect of cognitive reappraisal is more significant in this relationship. CONCLUSION(S): Kumpfer's resilience framework is found to apply to emergency nurses. Perceived organizational support, an environmental factor, affects resilience directly and positively. In addition, cognitive reappraisal and general self-efficacy, which are individual factors, mediate this influence path. These findings suggest an interaction between environmental and individual factors in determining the resilience of emergency nurses. IMPACT: These findings have implications for developing resilience intervention strategies for emergency nurses exposed to occupational violence. Enhancing personal attributes such as general self-efficacy and cognitive reappraisal is as significant as strengthening external organizational support environments for enhancing nurses' resilience. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Emergency nurses participated in the pilot test of our questionnaire survey and gave their opinions on the questionnaire design. SUMMARY STATEMENT: What is already known about the topic? In emergency rooms, workplace violence is prevalent, and it seriously endangers nurses' physical and mental health. Enhancing resilience can improve nurses' ability to self-regulate after experiencing violence. However, the drivers and mechanisms of resilience among emergency nurses who have experienced workplace violence remain unidentified. What this paper adds? This study confirms the applicability of Kumpfer's resilience framework to emergency nurses who have experienced workplace violence. Nurses' self-efficacy and cognitive reappraisal mediate the relationship between perceived organizational support and resilience after exposure to workplace violence. The resilience process for emergency nurses involves the interaction of individual and environmental factors. Implications for practice/policy. Managers and researchers should consider the interaction between individual and environmental factors when developing resilience intervention strategies for emergency nurses who have suffered workplace violence. It is essential to support emergency nurses from the dyadic dimensions of the environment and the individual. A supportive organizational environment and individual positive adjustment strategies are equally important in promoting resilience among nurses.Copyright © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Stress is an inevitable part of life that individuals face. Stress occurs when stressful events, whether personal, environmental, or social, affect an individual's ability to cope and threaten the breakdown of their psychological and physical systems. Stress can create difficulties and obstacles that may exceed an individual's ability to tolerate and deal with them, causing them stress and having negative effects on their psychological and physical health. The current study aimed to identify the negative effects of psychological stress on the psychological and physical health of individuals through the literature that has addressed this topic. The results of the study showed that among the negative effects of stress on psychological health are the deterioration of individuals' self-concept, feelings of frustration, poor adjustment, and the appearance of symptoms of various psychological disorders. The negative effects of stress on the physical health of individuals are represented by the weakening of the immune system and the occurrence of various infections, as well as the occurrence of high blood pressure, heart and vascular diseases, diabetes, digestive system diseases, and skin diseases. Objective(s): The primary objective of this study was to assess the coping strategies employed by nurses working in psychiatric wards at a Saudi hospital in the eastern province. Additionally, the study aimed to explore potential relationships between the levels of coping and various demographic characteristics among these nurses. Method(s): A descriptive study was conducted over a period spanning from September 14th to December 18th, 2022. The study sample consisted of 90 nurses who were purposefully selected from psychiatric wards at a Saudi hospital in the eastern province. To achieve the study's objectives, the researchers utilized the Brief COPE inventory, a modified version developed by Carver (1997), which comprises 28 items categorized into 14 domains. Conclusion(s): The study's findings revealed a noteworthy relationship between active coping strategies, reduced job stress, and increased support, which was associated with decreased job stress among nurses. In essence, the data indicates that enhancing active coping can lead to a decrease in job-related stress among nurses. Recommendations: Considering the study's findings, it is recommended that nurses working in psychiatric wards should undergo specialized training sessions aimed at improving their coping skills and stress management. Moreover, there should be clear professional guidelines and criteria governing the relationships between nurses and other healthcare team members in these specific work settings. These measures can contribute to a more supportive and harmonious work environment for nurses in psychiatric wards.Copyright © 2023 EManuscript Technologies. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT)-the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and digital mental health applications-has been increasingly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. As a resource-efficient treatment approach, bCBT appears promising for addressing the growing need for mental health care services, for example, as an early intervention before the chronification of symptoms. However, further research on the efficacy and feasibility of integrated bCBT interventions is needed. Objective(s): This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel bCBT program comprising short (25 min), weekly face-to-face therapy sessions combined with a smartphone-based digital health app for treating mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety. Method(s): This prospective uncontrolled trial comprised 2 measurement points (before and after treatment) and 2 intervention groups. We recruited university students with mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety. On the basis of the primary symptoms, participants were assigned to either a depression intervention group (n=67 completers) or an anxiety intervention group (n=33 completers). Participants in each group received 6 weekly individual psychotherapy sessions via videoconference and completed modules tailored to their respective symptoms in the smartphone-based digital health app. Result(s): The depression group displayed medium to large improvements in the symptoms of depression (Cohen d=-0.70 to -0.90; P<.001). The anxiety group experienced significant improvements in the symptoms of generalized anxiety assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale with a large effect size (Cohen d=-0.80; P<.001) but not in symptoms of anxiety assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Cohen d=-0.35; P=.06). In addition, both groups experienced significant improvements in their perceived self-efficacy (Cohen d=0.50; P<.001 in the depression group and Cohen d=0.71; P<.001 in the anxiety group) and quality of life related to psychological health (Cohen d=0.87; P<.001 in the depression group and Cohen d=0.40; P=.03 in the anxiety group). Work and social adjustment of patients improved significantly in the depression group (Cohen d=-0.49; P<.001) but not in the anxiety group (Cohen d=-0.06; P=.72). Patients' mental health literacy improved in the anxiety group (Cohen d=0.45; P=.02) but not in the depression group (Cohen d=0.21; P=.10). Patient satisfaction with the bCBT program and ratings of the usability of the digital app were high in both treatment groups. Conclusion(s): This study provides preliminary evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of a novel brief bCBT intervention. The intervention effects were generalized across a broad spectrum of patient-reported outcomes. Hence, the newly developed bCBT intervention appears promising for treating mild to moderate depression and anxiety in young adults.Copyright © Authors.

N2  - PURPOSE: To test the efficacy of a self-management program based on acceptance and commitment therapy on quality of life, emotional distress, fatigue, physical activity, and fruit and vegetable intake in patients with colorectal cancer. METHOD(S): The study was a randomized controlled trial. A sample of 156 patients with colorectal cancer (stage I-III) was recruited by convenience sampling and participants were allocated randomly assigned to control or intervention groups. The intervention included a colorectal cancer self-management information booklet, two personal skills training sessions, and 12 follow-up telephone calls. The control group received health education leaflets. Outcome variables were assessed in both groups at baseline and every two months thereafter during the six-month follow-up period. RESULT(S): The mean age of participants was 62 years (range: 30-89 years). Generalized estimation equations analyses revealed significant differences over time in changes in anxiety (beta = -2.22, p = 0.001), depression (beta = -1.48, p = 0.033), fatigue (beta = 4.46, p = 0.001), physical and functional measures (beta = 6.16, p = 0.005), and colorectal-cancer-specific quality of life (beta = 7.45, p = 0.012). However, there were no significant differences in changes in physical activity or fruit and vegetable intake over time. CONCLUSION(S): The self-management skills provided by oncology nurses, including symptom management, psychological adjustment, and relaxation exercises, help colorectal cancer patients to overcome the challenges of cancer survivorship, accelerate their recovery, and improve their quality of life.

N2  - AIM: Evaluate and compare the impact of a resilience-based intervention on emotional regulation, grit and life satisfaction among female Egyptian and Saudi nursing students. BACKGROUND: Nursing students should experience a comprehensive learning environment since they are mind-body-spirit creatures. Therefore, nursing education should emphasize growing students' physical, social, emotional and spiritual well-being in addition to their knowledge, skills and attitudes. DESIGN: This study followed a parallel arm randomized controlled trial design. Study participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups in a (1:1) ratio. It was conducted between January 2023 and the end of April 2023. METHOD(S): Students were randomly allocated to the eight-week resilience intervention (n= 60) or a control (n= 60) group (half of the students in each group were from each country). The intervention group received a pamphlet and attended eight weekly 15-person sessions on resilience, grit (perseverance), emotional regulation and self-care. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, the Short Grit Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scales were administered pre- and immediately post-intervention. RESULT(S): Between pre- and post-intervention, there were significant improvements in grit (from 41.374.27 to 51.235.22 among Egyptian students with an effect size of 0.663 and from 42.974.30 to 54.103.87 among Saudi students with an effect size of 0.800), as well as mean emotional regulation (from 36.635.11 to 55.707.51 among Egyptian students with an effect size of 0.818 and from 44.606.87 to 61. With a substantial effect size of 0.850 (p0.001), Egyptian nursing students experienced a more significant rise in mean life satisfaction than Saudi nursing students (18.336.54 to 29.305.14). CONCLUSION(S): Resilience-based interventions enhanced emotional regulation, grit and life satisfaction in Egyptian and Saudi female nursing students. Grit, resilience and emotional regulation should be incorporated into nurse training to equip female students with the necessary values and protective factors to succeed in their studies. Given the unique challenges and stressors that female nursing students may face, nursing programs and institutions must provide resources and support services to help students manage stress and build resilience.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To critically synthesis the qualitative literature to understand the experiences of critical care nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: A meta-aggregation systematic review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Relevant online databases were searched using a wide range of keywords and subject headings. All qualitative studies were included to understand the lived experiences of critical care nurses in the intensive care unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. All studies were screened using a pre-eligibility screening criteria by three reviewers. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research was used to provide methodological appraisal. The JBI method of meta-aggregation was used to extract, synthesize, and categorise the data. FINDINGS: 17 publications met the inclusion criteria. 136 individual findings were extracted, which were synthesised into 18 categories and eight synthesised findings. The eight synthesised findings included,1) Working as a team to adapt to the challenges of the pandemic, 2) Striving to provide patient centred care, 3) Coping with frequent deaths in the intensive care unit, 4) Challenges of supporting patients family from a distance, 5) The psychological impact of caring for critically unwell patients with COVID-19, 6) Working through the challenges of the intensive care unit setting during the pandemic, 7) The challenges of wearing personal protective equipment while undertaking patient care, 8) The impact of working in the intensive care unit during the pandemic on life at home.. CONCLUSION(S): This qualitative systematic review has given new insight into the lived experiences of critical care nurses. There were significant psychological and physical impacts on critical care nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, improving psychological support, maintaining adequate staffing levels/skill mix to ensure basic nursing care can be completed, and the attendance of leadership/management staff is essential to ensure the retention of critical care nurses and achieve optimal patient outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review has highlighted implications for staff retention (counselling, skills development, contingency staffing), the need for improved management/leadership strategies and human resource policies to support critical care nurses when hospitals are in crisis. Additionally, the presence and needs of the family members of critically unwell patients' needs to be prioritised in the intensive care unit.Crown Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Compassion Fatigue in Nurses Providing Palliative Cancer Care and Coping Strategies to Prevent and Manage it
A1  - Pehlivan Saribudak T. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: End-of-life care for cancer patients is one of the most challenging experiences encountered by nurses. Cancer nurses providing end-of-life care may experience compassion fatigue due to prolonged exposure to the suffering and intense emotional reactions of patients, death and the dying, and grieving families. However, the development of resilience and effective coping skills can decrease nurse turnover rates and increase the quality of palliative cancer care. This article discusses the concept of compassion fatigue, how it develops, compassion fatigue experienced by nurses providing palliative cancer care, and the Compassion Fatigue Resiliency Program (CFRP) coping method. DATA SOURCES: Author experience and journal articles were used. CONCLUSION(S): Compassion fatigue can occur from secondary traumatic stress and burnout after nurses' prolonged and intense exposure to helping suffering patients, resulting in decreased ability to care, expend energy, or exhibit empathy and compassion. The CFRP is a structured, comprehensive training program designed to educate nurses about compassion fatigue and enable them to develop a support network, strengthen their coping skills, and improve resilience. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: It is recommended that the CFRP be included in in-service training in institutions and be applied to oncology nurses at regular intervals in a block program format (1-2 days). Newly recruited oncology nurses in particular should be supported with such training in orientation programs. Institutional managers play an important role in organizing such programs and screening for the risk of compassion fatigue in nurses who provide end-of-life care.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: Worsening student mental health, along with more complex mental illness presentation and increased access to campus mental health services, has led to a mental health "crisis" on campuses. One way to address student mental health needs may be through mental health programs which have been found to increase resiliency and help-seeking, and reduce stigma. Participant(s): The effectiveness of The Inquiring Mind (TIM), a mental health promotion and mental illness stigma reduction program, was examined in 810 students from 16 Canadian post-secondary institutions. Methods and Results: Using a meta-analytic approach, TIM improved resiliency and decreased stigmatizing attitudes from pre to post, with medium effect sizes (d>.50). Analyses with those that completed the follow-up (about one-third of the sample) showed that effects were mostly retained at three months. Other outcomes also point to the program's effectiveness. Conclusion(s): TIM appears to be an effective program for post-secondary students. However, additional research, including randomized control trials, is needed to address study limitations.

N2  - Mindfulness is a concept that refers to the process of attending to and experiencing the present moment with in-tentional attention, awareness, acceptance, and a non-judgmental attitude. Healthcare professionals face difficult situations in their workplace and experience stress and pressure. Mindfulness is a means of promoting the well-be-ing of healthcare professionals, exerting a preventive effect on the negative psychosomatic health effects caused by occupational stress and burnout. The benefits of mindfulness for healthcare professionals include reducing levels of stress, depression and burnout. It also contributes to the cultivation of empathy and the development of resilience. Those who engage in mindfulness practices have better self-care, empowerment, focus, spirituality, awareness of self and emotions, satisfaction with self and accomplishments, emotional intelligence, and self-control. Overall, it contributes to their well-being and self-improvement by enhancing the feeling of personal fulfillment. Healthcare professionals can engage in mindfulness practices such as Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mind-fulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Enhancing the education of healthcare professionals in mindfulness and integrating mindfulness into the lives of healthcare professionals will positively impact their quality of life, clinical skills and, ultimately, patient outcomes.Copyright © Athens Medical Society.

N2  - Objectives: Second victim syndrome refers to the negative mental and emotional after-effects physicians may experience after adverse patient outcomes. We evaluated the impact of second victim status on physician self-efficacy, burnout, perceived stress, and sleep patterns. Method(s): Physicians at a university hospital voluntarily participated in an anonymous, survey which included second victim status, General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE), Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Insomnia Severity Index. The total possible survey points were: GSE, 40; CBI, 95; PSS, 40; and Insomnia Severity Index, 28. The Student t test for independent samples and Mantel-Haenszel were used to compare second victim with nonsecond victims. Result(s): Of the 115 respondents, 85 (74%) provided second victim status: 48% female, 93% non-Hispanic White, 35% surgeons, and 53% in practice for more than 20 years. There were 24 (28%) self-reported second victims. Demographics were similar between groups. GSE scores were comparable: second victim versus nonsecond victim: 31.4 vs 32.6 (P =.13), but fewer second victims reported that they could accomplish their goals (79.2 vs 88.7%; P =.03). Overall, 56% of physicians had CBI scores consistent with moderate burnout. Mean CBI scores were similar for both groups 56.6 vs 52.4; P =.17). Work-related burnout (22.9 vs 21.9; P =.44) and personal burnout (18.9 vs 17.3; P =.17) were comparable, but second victims more commonly reported patient-related burnout (15.3 vs 12.9; P =.039). Second victims responded often or always more frequently to questions regarding patients being hard to work with (8.3% vs 1.6%; P =.03), frustrating (12.5% vs 3.3%; P =.02), draining energy (16.7% vs 5%; P =.018), or wondering how long they could continue to work with patients (16.7% vs 11.5%; P =.039). There was no difference in mean PSS for lack of control (11.7 vs 10.5; P =.28) or ability to cope with existing stressors (10.0 vs 10.6; P =.34). Mean insomnia scores were comparable (9.4 vs 7.7; P =.22), but second victims experienced problems with waking too early more often (29.2% vs 14.5%; P =.01). Official debriefing and individualized counseling or coaching to cope with the event were top resources desired by second victims (54%). Mandatory time off or mandatory meetings with a psychiatrist or psychologist were least favored (8%). Conclusion(s): More than 25% of physicians have experienced second victim sequalae, which do not distinguish by demographics. Despite high-level GSE, moderate burnout was present in more than 50% of physicians, irrespective of second victim status. Patient-related burnout was particularly evident among second victims. These numbers are alarming and should be addressed promptly by medical societies and hospitals. A valuable starting point may be offering individualized counseling for all physicians.Copyright © 2023

Management of RDFBIs is often quite challenging. It provides a sense of power and control to the patient, attracting attention and care; this potentially triggers repetitive similar behaviors. A 35-year-old female with multiple prior admissions for recurrent deliberate foreign body ingestions (RDFBI), borderline personality disorder (BPD), post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), presented with epigastric pain and nausea after ingesting multiple foreign bodies (FB). She has previously undergone innumerable endoscopies and laparotomies for removal of FB. Abdominal radiograph demonstrated FB in the stomach, presumed to be batteries and butter knife. Following endoscopic retrieval, she was admitted for psychiatric evaluation. While in-patient, she ingested batteries from television remote and nasal bridge holders of facemasks despite constant watch, requiring repeat endoscopies. She desired inpatient psychiatric care but multiple psychiatric facilities have declined to provide inpatient therapy; there is concern that this rejection might have contributed to self-injurious behavior. Queries and concerns were raised regarding ongoing urgent endoscopic interventions given that it seemed to offer little utility in ameliorating the underlying psychiatric problem. It was questioned whether repeated admissions and endoscopy could be potentiating her behavior, as it enabled the patient to get the attention she desired. A multidisciplinary team meeting involving Internists, Gastroenterologists, Emergency Room Physicians, Psychiatry, Ethics and Care Management was held. With the goal of ensuring that the needs of patient come first and providing care in empathetic and safe manner, while minimizing the burdens and risks of emergent endoscopies and prolonged hospitalization, an interdisciplinary care protocol was devised. This protocol delineates clear care pathway for when patients with RDFBIs present to our facility and are in need of either emergent or urgent endoscopy, in the presence or absence of suicidal ideation. Should the patient need admission, additional guidance on extra safety measures and stringent environmental risk assessment strategies are incorporated in the protocol. Since the inception of this protocol, frequency of out-of-hours endoscopies and urgent endoscopies for ingestion of FBs while remaining inpatient, have reduced. Although dedicated psychiatric inpatient rehabilitation is a crucial component to disrupt such self-injurious behavior, it unfortunately remains an unmet need in our healthcare system. As much as physicians should respect patient autonomy and not deny care, it is crucial to recognize self-destructive behavioral patterns, and take measures to break that cycle by adopting a more comprehensive approach focusing on the underlying psychiatric condition, incorporating and maximizing counseling and behavioral therapies.

N2  - Background: Patients living with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) commonly experience a number of mental health-related challenges, specifically anxiety and mood disorders (AMDs). Although there has been an awareness of the relationship between IBD and AMD within the GI research and clinical space; detection, treatment, and management amongst care providers is limited. Therefore, we are seeking to explore the overall experiences of patients living with Inflammatory Bowel Disease to identify and evaluate their experiences in interactions with GI clinicians around mental health in diverse care settings in order to determine how to best support mental health care amongst IBD patients. Purpose(s): We aimed to explore perspectives, experiences and barriers to engaging with mental health-related challenges amongst IBD patients when interacting with gastroenterologists over the course of their health journey. Method(s): We conducted 5 semi-structured online focus groups co-facilitated by patient researchers in early 2020 through Zoom which spanned for a total of 2.5 hours each. Participants were recruited through social media channels, GI clinics, the IMAGINE-SPOR unit, and Crohn's and Colitis Canada. A semi-structured interview guide was developed for patient researchers to follow during the focus groups which provided guided questions that would allow patient participants to explore and reflect on: their experiences living with IBD, their expectations around mental health support, their perception of the engagement of GIs in mental health discussions, and their expectations for mental health support and services moving forward. Audio recordings from the semi-structured focus groups were then transcribed and thematic analysis was used to identify emerging themes and patient expectations. Result(s): We identified the following key themes: 1) experiences with IBD: difficulties related to reintegrating into social settings, feelings of loneliness; 2) expectations around mental health support: the need to develop their own resiliency strategies due to the lack of structural resources regarding mental health and IBD in the clinical space; 3) GI engagement: HCPs were dismissive of mental health symptoms, often gaslighting patients when mentioning mental health concerns during clinical encounters; and 4) expectations: a need to standardize mental health care across IBD care practice with a focus on potentially integrating healthcare providers of diverse care settings to help address the need for mental health support in such a vast patient population. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that effective detection, management and awareness, along with the integration of feedback from patient lived experiences can help inform the development of mental health support and services which cater to the needs of people living with IBD. Results from this study will be interpreted in line with insight gathered from upcoming interviews of gastroenterologists and HCPs.

N2  - RATIONALE: Racially marginalized patients with serious illness are more likely to experience poor provider communication compared to their White counterparts. Little research exists on how experiences with healthcare racism impact patient-clinician communication and patient decisionmaking. Prior work suggests patients of color want to discuss concerns about racism, but do not feel confident they will be taken seriously by their clinicians. We explored physician perspectives and feedback on a program designed to improve patient resilience around experiences of racism. METHOD(S): Physicians who specialize in caring for patients with serious illness were recruited from a county hospital and tertiary medical center affiliated with the University of Washington. Participants completed a basic demographic questionnaire and semi-structured interviews regarding two patient-clinician scenarios in which anxiety about racism was a key contextual feature. We then described a program designed to bolster personal resilience-skills with an opportunity to create a new module focused specifically on experiences of racism and discrimination, and queried: perceptions and potential impact on patient-clinician communication. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. We used Public Health Critical Race Praxis, a pragmatic form of Critical Race Theory, as both framework and processes for analyses. RESULT(S): Twenty-one physicians enrolled in the study with a response rate of 60%. Participants were mostly women (67%) with a median age of 41 years and median experience of 8 years as an attending physician in pulmonary and critical care, nephrology, infectious disease, or gastroenterology. Four participants identified as Asian and three identified as Black. Participants felt positively about the program's ability to improve patient resilience and selfefficacy and were concerned about it's the length of the program and potential burden for racially marginalized, seriously ill patients. Physicians reported being open to having mediated conversations with patients through the program to discuss patients' experiences of bias, racism, and discrimination in healthcare. However, participants also requested time to process difficult feedback, mental and physical space to manage initial defensiveness, and a pragmatic anti-racism framework to use when approaching patients. Overall, participants were optimistic the addition of an anti-racism module to the program could improve patient-clinician communication and empower patients. CONCLUSION(S): Participating physicians were open to facilitated conversations with racially marginalized patients with serious illness to address and communicate about healthcare racism. These findings will help to develop and evaluate the integration of a novel anti-racism module in a program designed to improve patient resilience and enhance patient-clinician communication.

N2  - Rationale: Creative arts therapy (CAT) is a potential intervention to mitigate health care professionals (HCP) burnout and build resilience. In a randomized trial of HCPs, we identified that a 12-week CAT program reduced psychological distress (anxiety, depression, PTSD, and burnout) and turnover intention in HCP measured oneweek post-intervention[1]. We now report the long-term impact up to one year after the intervention. Method(s): We followed clinical trial participants from September 2020 until July 2021. All participants completed baseline and postintervention surveys evaluating symptoms of anxiety, depression, burnout, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and positive and negative affect. Participants in the intervention groups completed similar surveys after 4 months, 8 months, and 1 year from the intervention. The participants in the control group completed surveys at the one-year mark only. One sample t-tests were used to determine if there was a significant change in outcomes from baseline to each timepoint. ANCOVAs were used to model the change in difference (post- minus preintervention) based on baseline value and group (intervention vs. control) at the one-year mark. Result(s): A total of 146 participants completed the clinical trial. On average, participants were 35 years old, white (85%), female (92%), 52% were nurses, and 10% were physicians [Table 1]. Of those, 104 (72%) completed the long-term follow-up surveys - 81 Intervention and 23 Control. Compared to their pre-intervention baseline, the intervention group sustained improvements in anxiety (p<0.001, p<0.001), depression (p<0.001, p<0.001), total PTSD score (p<0.001, p=0.001), emotional exhaustion (p=0.06, p=0.04), resilience (p=0.006, p=0.02), wellness (p<0.001, p<0.001), social support (p=0.56, p=0.03), and negative coping skills (p<0.001, p=0.004) at 4 and 8 months. Compared to control participants, the intervention group showed improvements at one year in anxiety (p<0.001), depression (p=0.05), positive affect (p<0.001), negative affect (p=0.001), social support (p=0.002), and wellness (p=0.004), but not in total PTSD scores (p=0.2), emotional exhaustion (p=0.22), resilience (p=0.23), and negative coping skills (p=0.28). Conclusion(s): Many effects of CAT remained up to one year after the conclusion of the intervention, with persistent improvements. Further investigation should aim to better understand the reasons for the prolonged improvements in psychological distress, as well as how to effectively disseminate and implement CAT programs for HCPs.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Although military members often encounter significant atypical stressors while serving, many service members are still reluctant to seek mental health (MH) treatment. Help-seeking behavior for MH needs is a rising concern for active duty Air Force personnel. Conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse are just a few issues that military members deal with, but things like stigma, attitudes toward MH, and behavioral control might keep these individuals from seeking services. This study utilizes the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to identify better and understand barriers to the help-seeking behavior of active duty Air Force members. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 2017 Air Force Community Feedback Tool was used for this study. This confidential survey was completed by a large sample of the military population (N=10,705). The survey was used to examine relationships between the TPB-related variables and respondents with mood problems identifying a need for professional counseling, seeking MH services, and reporting that the services met their needs. Multiple linear and binary logistic regression models were utilized to analyze findings from this sample. RESULT(S): This study highlights how attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control impact help-seeking behavior for these individuals. Findings include the MH providers' good reputations, wait times for services, ease of access to care, and negative experiences with supervisor permission, all of which showed a statistically significant impact on help-seeking behavior. Dependent variables included "I need professional counseling," "I contacted a MH care provider in the past year to try to meet this need," and "How much the MH care provider helped you meet your needs." Each of these variables had statistically significant relationships with the connecting variables of the TPB. CONCLUSION(S): Findings from this study reveal how attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control play an essential role in an active duty Air Force member's decision to seek help for MH concerns. This study suggests that active duty military members are less concerned about the belief that seeking MH care could harm their reputations and more aware of the potential negative reputations of MH clinics. Finally, actionable steps are outlined to better support help-seeking behavior, which might be recommended to better train and encourage military leaders to address the MH needs of themselves and the members of their units.Copyright © The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2022.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study analyzed the effect of emergency nurses' psychological resilience on their thanatophobic behaviors. METHOD(S): The research was conducted with 156 emergency nurses. In the data collection process, the Socio-Demographic Information Form, the Brief Resilience Scale, and the Thanatophobia Scale were used. RESULT(S): It was found that emergency nurses had medium-level psychological resilience and high-level thanatophobia. Besides, it was discerned that there was a moderate negative relationship between psychological resilience and thanatophobia (r:-.643, p: 0.000). Lastly, as per the simple linear regression analysis, it was identified that the predictor variable of psychological resilience accounted for 40.9% of the variance in the predicted variable of thanatophobia (R2:.409, p: 0.000). PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Emergency nurses, who are faced with many negative situations, need to have a high level of psychological resilience in order to get out of the mental state brought by negative conditions as soon as possible, and it is recommended to carry out applications to increase psychological resilience.

N2  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To detect the mediating effect of resilience on the relationship between perceived social support and burnout in Chinese palliative nurses. BACKGROUND: Palliative nurses are a group that is vulnerable to burnout. Perceived social support may contribute to decreasing palliative nurses' burnout and facilitating their personal resilience, and resilience may be associated with lower levels of burnout. However, these relationships were unclear in the Chinese context. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design. METHOD(S): The STROBE guideline was performed to report this study. A mixed sampling method including convenience sampling and stratified sampling was used to recruit participants, and a total of 319 palliative nurses completed the Nursing Burnout Scale, the Perceived Social Support Scale and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale from May 2021 to September 2021. Influencing factors were primarily identified using independent-sample t tests and one-way ANOVA. Bootstrap method was used to detect the mediating effect of resilience. RESULT(S): The level of burnout in palliative nurses (23.4+/-7.68) was higher than that of general nurses in China. Education level, health condition and monthly income were influencing factors of burnout. Resilience was detected as a mediator in the relationships between perceived social support and dimensions of burnout. CONCLUSION(S): Chinese palliative nurses experience a relatively high level of burnout, which may be influenced by several sociodemographic variables. Resilience could mediate the effect of perceived social support on the dimensions of burnout. Problem-oriented and palliative-tailored strategies should be developed to further address burnout in Chinese palliative nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurse managers and policy makers should support nurse ongoing education, adopt health-promoting interventions and optimise salary systems. In addition, perceived social support resources and resilience training programmes are also warranted. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: All participants were invited to complete the informed consent form and paper questionnaires. Human resource managers helped us collect some subjective data through the personnel management system. Nurse managers of palliative units conducted regular staff meetings to promote the data collection process.Copyright © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Background: While many elaborated treatment protocols focus on post-traumatic stress symptoms, a large number of refugees suffer from a range of mental health problems. Thus, brief and transdiagnostic psychological interventions may be helpful first interventions for help-seeking refugees and asylum seekers in a stepped-care approach. Critically, there is limited research on how transdiagnostic interventions are received in general practice in non-specialized mental healthcare settings in high-income countries, where often only mental health professionals (MHPs) are legally allowed to treat people with mental disorders. MHPs may thus deliver such interventions, but their perspective towards them has not yet been investigated. Objective(s): We aimed to investigate MHPs' perception of the usability of adapted Problem Management Plus (aPM+), a brief transdiagnostic psychological intervention for refugees, which we adapted to address distress caused by post-migration living difficulties (PMLDs). Method(s): Employing an e-learning tool, we introduced the aPM+ intervention to 59 MHPs and assessed their perspective towards the intervention. We then used an inductive approach to analyse their perspective towards the intervention with open-ended questions. Result(s): Altogether, 59 MHPs enrolled in the webinar and 29 provided feedback on the intervention. MHPs had a positive view on the intervention but emphasized the importance of situation-specific adaptations to the structure of the manual. The most favoured specific strategies were 'managing stress/slow-breathing', the 'tree of capabilities', and the 'riding the anger' exercise. The last two were additionally developed to reduce distress caused by PMLDs by either enhancing self-efficacy or reducing anger regulation difficulties. Conclusion(s): An adaptation to aPM+ regarding more flexibility of the manual may enhance the likelihood of MHPs implementing the intervention in their daily practice. Strategies addressing coping with PMLDs could be particularly helpful.Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register identifier: DRKS00016538. HIGHLIGHTS: Mental health professionals had a positive view on a brief transdiagnostic psychological intervention for refugees but emphasized the importance of situation-specific adaptations to the structure of the manual.Low -intensity interventions may be useful not only in low- and middle-income countries but also in high-income countries as part of a stepped-care approach, even if distributed by MHPs instead of trained laypersons.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - The College of Public Health at East Tennessee State University started a program in 2011 to teach the skills needed to protect and promote health and well-being in resource-limited settings. The need to provide public health services in resource-limited settings exists in both wilderness and isolated settings and when a disaster disrupts basic societal infrastructure. In these settings, lives may depend on the ability to provide water, sanitation, hygiene, shelter, first aid, and other basic services. Over the last decade, the college expanded the program considerably into what is now known as Project EARTH (Employing Available Resources to Transform Health) that now includes several different academic courses as well as programs designed to develop innovative solutions to address the needs of people in resource-limited settings. Working in a resource-limited setting requires effectively utilizing locally available resources to improve and protect people's health and well-being. Project EARTH focuses on teaching students to design and create specific products for these situations while progressively honing those cross-cutting skills necessary to work effectively in these settings-notably teamwork, creativity, and resilience. To this end, Project EARTH implements a sequential learning process that includes significant hands-on training and simulated experiences with debriefing opportunities at the end of each activity. Project EARTH may serve as a useful model for others considering a similar training program.Copyright © 2022 Wilderness Medical Society. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the lived experiences of informal caregivers for pregnant women seeking scheduled antenatal care during the early stage of China's COVID-19 lockdown and potential measures to address the challenges. DESIGN: This is a phenomenological qualitative study. SETTING: The study was carried out in a leading teaching hospital in Southwest China. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 15 informal caregivers for healthy pregnant women on routine antenatal visits about six months after China launched the city-wide lockdown and other control measures for COVID-19, including 10 males and 5 females with diverse demographic backgrounds. MEASURES AND FINDINGS: The research team developed a demographic form and an interview outline with key questions, conducted semi-structured interviews with the informal caregivers, and analyzed the data using the Colazzie's method. Five themes of lived experiences were revealed, i.e., increased caregiving burdens, disruption of routines in family life, lack of accurate information and knowledge, active role adjustment, and positive attitudes and coping in a difficult time. Some caregivers reacted positively to the lockdown experience and saw it as an opportunity to rethink their lives and improve family relations. KEY CONCLUSION(S): The informal caregivers experienced increased physical and psychological burdens. Strategies such as adoption of a less frequent prenatal visit schedule, use of tele-medicine technologies, and provision of accurate information and knowledge may help to ease the increased informal caregiving burdens. Psychological counseling, community services and disaster response policies specially targeting pregnant women and their informal caregivers may also be valuable resources. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Attention should be drawn to the group of informal caregivers for pregnant women during a COVID-19 lockdown, including professional assistance delivered by nursing and other related professionals. Measures are called for to minimize exposure opportunities such as adoption of a new prenatal care schedule and tele-medicine technologies. Patient education with reliable information should be provided, preferably by nursing staff and physicians. Social support efforts including professional mental counseling may added and work with other resources such as community services and policy makers.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in vulnerable groups, such as pregnant and parenting women, is a critical research and clinical imperative. Although many survey-based perinatal health studies have contributed important information about mental health, few have given full voice about the experiences of pregnant and postpartum women during the prolonged worldwide pandemic using a qualitative approach. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study is to explore the lived experience of pregnant and postpartum women in the United States during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Qualitative phenomenological study. SETTING: This study was conducted in the community, by recruiting women throughout the U.S. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-four pregnant and postpartum women participated in qualitative interviews. METHOD(S): Data from one-on-one semi-structured interviews were analyzed using a team-based phenomenological qualitative approach. RESULT(S): Two key themes were apparent: the pandemic has shined a light on the many typical struggles of motherhood; and, there is a lack of consistent, community-based or healthcare system resources available to address the complex needs of pregnant and postpartum women, both in general and during the pandemic. CONCLUSION(S): Going forward, as the world continues to deal with the current pandemic and possible future global health crises, health care systems and providers are encouraged to consider the suggestions provided by these participants: talk early and often to women about mental health; help pregnant and postpartum women create and institute a personal plan for early support of their mental health needs and create an easily accessible mental health network; conceptualize practice methods that enhance coping and resilience; practice in community-based and interdisciplinary teams (e.g., midwives, doulas, perinatal social workers/ psychotherapists) to ensure continuity of care and to foster relationships between providers and pregnant/ postpartum women; and consider learning from other countries' successful perinatal healthcare practices. REGISTRATION: Number (& date of first recruitment): not applicable. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Pregnant and postpartum women insist that mental health care must be overhauled, stating the pandemic has highlighted inherent cracks in the system.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: Cancer patients have faced intersecting crises during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review aimed to examine patients' and caregivers' experiences of accessing cancer services during the pandemic and its perceived impact on their psychological wellbeing. Patients and Methods: A protocol-led (CRD42020214906) systematic review was conducted by searching six databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL for articles published in English-language between 1/2020 and 12/2020. Data were extracted using a pilot-tested, structured data extraction form. Thematic synthesis of data was undertaken and reported as per the PRISMA guideline. Result(s): A total of 1110 articles were screened, of which 19 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies originated from 10 different countries including the US, UK, India and China. Extracted data were categorised into seven themes. Postponement and delays in cancer screening and treatment, drug shortages and inadequate nursing care were commonly experienced by patients. Hospital closures, resource constraints, national lockdowns and patient reluctance to use health services due to infection worries contributed to the delay. Financial and social distress, isolation, and spiritual distress were also commonly reported. Caregivers in addition felt anxious about infecting cancer patients with COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Patients and caregivers experienced delays in cancer screening, treatment and care during the COVID-19 pandemic and negatively affected their psychological wellbeing. Their views and preferences should be accounted to minimise the impact of the current and any future pandemics and ensure resilient cancer services.

N2  - Introduction: This study compares rates of depression, suicidal ideation, and burnout among resident/fellow and attending physicians in orthopaedic surgery to other specialties during height/end of the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at our institution. Main outcomes and measures included suicidal ideation, Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression (PHQ-9) scores for depression, and 2 single-item measures for emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. This study provides valuable information regarding orthopaedic surgeon mental health during world crises. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional survey-based study of resident, fellow, and attending physicians from 26 specialties during and after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic at our institution from April 24, 2020 to May 15, 2020. The survey contained 22 items. This includes consent, demographics and general data, 2 single-item questions of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, and the PHQ-9. Subjects were eligible if they were a resident/fellow or attending physician at our institution. Result(s): The response rate for the study was 16.31%. Across all specialties rates were 6.2% depression, 19.6% burnout, and 6.6% suicidal ideation. The results for orthopaedic surgeons are as follows: 0% tentative diagnosis of depression, 3.8% suicidal ideation, and 4% burnout. Anesthesiology had the highest rate of depression (14.3%). Internal medicine and other non-surgical specialties had the highest rate of suicidal ideation (10.2%). Orthopaedic surgeons were significantly more likely to achieve work-life balance and experience less burnout than anesthesiologists and pediatricians. Discussion(s): Depression, suicidal ideation, and burnout continue to affect physicians across all specialties. These issues are amplified in light of crisis. Job satisfaction and rigorous training may be protective factors that allow orthopaedic surgeons to adapt to novel clinical settings under stress when compared to anesthesiologists and pediatricians. Resilience training and stress management strategies should continue to be investigated to better prepare physicians for world crises.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Objectives: The study investigated the role of social capital, self-efficacy, and depression as determinants of stress during pregnancy. Material(s) and Method(s): In a cross-sectional study, 200 low-risk pregnant women with at least 5 years of education and ages 18 or more were enrolled in public obstetric clinics of Babol University of Medical Sciences. The participants completed four questionnaires including Social Capital, Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ), Perceived Stress, and General Self-efficacy. Result(s): Women at late phase of pregnancy had lower mean scores of total social capital (61.5 +/- 17.1 vs. 47.1 +/- 18.1) and self-efficacy (60.1 +/- 9.7 vs. 55.1 +/- 15.2) compared to those at early pregnancy. Social capital was the negative independent variable associated with pregnancy-specific stress in the adjusted model (beta =-0.418, P = 0.020). Both social capital (beta =-0.563, P <= 0.001) and self-efficacy (beta =-0.330, P <= 0.001) were negative independent variables associated with general stress. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that health professionals should note the benefits of social capital in stress management and encourage women in establishing stronger relations and neighborhood environments during pregnancy.Copyright © 2020 Tzu Chi Medical Journal  Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder commonly caused by a traumatic event(s) and prevalent among service members and veterans. Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) is an emerging "mind-body" psychotherapy for PTSD that is generally briefer and less expensive than current first-line treatments, such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure (PE) therapy. This study examined the results of ART for treatment of military-related PTSD, with stratification by prior PTSD treatment types, including service members/veterans with reported residual PTSD symptoms following receipt of first-line recommended psychotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups were constructed and compared based on self-reported prior PTSD treatment history: treatment-naive (n=33), pharmacotherapy only (n=40), first-line psychotherapy (CPT and/or PE) (n=33), and other psychotherapy (n=42). Participants were assessed for PTSD symptoms at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up using the 17-item Military PTSD Checklist (PCL-M), as well as assessment of depressive, anxiety, and sleep symptoms. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at University of South Florida. RESULT(S): Among 148 veterans/service members who enrolled and started treatment with ART, 106 (71.6%) completed treatment in a mean of 3.5 treatment sessions, and 55 (51.9%) provided 6-month follow-up data. Mean age was 43.8years, 95% were male, and 84% were of white race. Within-group standardized effect sizes for pre-to-post changes in PTSD scores (PCL-M) were large at 1.48, 1.11, 1.88, and 1.03 for the treatment-naive, pharmacotherapy only, first-line psychotherapy, and other psychotherapy groups, respectively. Among treatment completers, the clinically significant treatment response rate (reduction of >=10 points on the PCL-M) was highest in the treatment-naive (83%) and first-line psychotherapy (88%) groups. Similar significant symptom reductions were observed for measures of depression and anxiety, and favorable treatment effects were generally sustained at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSION(S): In a brief treatment period, ART appears to result in substantial reductions in symptoms of PTSD among veterans, including those with residual PTSD symptoms after prior treatment with first-line psychotherapies endorsed by the U.S. Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. These results suggest that ART be considered as a potential first-line treatment modality for veterans with PTSD.Copyright © The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2021.

N2  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the psychosocial impact and identify risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes in healthcare professionals during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Cyprus. BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals are in the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic facing an unprecedented global health crisis, which can have consequences on their psychosocial health. There is a need to identify risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes to inform the design of tailored psychological interventions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online study. METHOD(S): A total of 1071 healthcare professionals completed self-report questionnaires. Measures included sociodemographic information, COVID-19-related characteristics, quality of life (Brief World Health Organization Quality of Life; WHOQOL-Bref), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; GAD-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8; PHQ-8), occupational burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory; CBI), and coping (Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced; Brief COPE). This article follows the STROBE reporting guidelines. RESULT(S): The prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety and clinically significant depression was 27.6% and 26.8%, respectively. Significant risk factors for poor psychological outcomes included being female, being a nurse or doctor (vs non-medical professional), working in frontline units (inpatient, intensive care), perceptions of inadequate workplace preparation to deal with the pandemic, and using avoidance coping. Depression and occupational burnout were significant risk factors for poor quality of life. CONCLUSION(S): The findings suggest several individual, psychosocial, and organisational risk factors for the adverse psychological outcomes observed in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study highlights the urgent need for screening for anxiety and depression and psychological interventions to combat an imminent mental health crisis in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic response protocols and public health initiatives aiming to improve and prevent mental health problems in healthcare professionals during the current and future health crises, need to account for the various factors at play.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Objective: This article reports findings from a qualitative study that sought to identify and describe psychosocial and mental health consequences of conflict among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and military veterans in Ukraine. The study was the first phase of a clinical intervention trial and was designed to understand local experiences of mental health problems and function, inform the selection and adaptation of local measures, and guide the modification, and implementation of a psychotherapy intervention that could support conflict-affected persons. Method(s): Free-list interviews (FLs), key informant interviews (KIIs), and focus group discussions (FDGs) were conducted with IDPs, military veterans, and providers working with these two groups. A total of 227 respondents were interviewed from two study regions in eastern Ukraine-Zaporizhia and Kharkiv-including 136 IDPs and 91 military veterans. Result(s): Both IDPs and veterans were described as experiencing high levels of psychological stress symptoms, including depression, isolation, anxiety, and intrusive memories. Although IDPs and veterans were exposed to different traumas, they both identified struggles with social adaptation, including feeling isolated and misunderstood by their communities. Both groups also described relational conflict within and outside the family. Social support mechanisms were considered essential for recovery, and positive social interaction was described as a key example of healthy functioning. Conclusion(s): Findings suggest a need for community-based programming that facilitates social adaptation, supports social network building, and helps engage conflict-affected people into mental health services. Programs that promote greater awareness, interaction, and understanding among the general public, military veterans, and IDPs are also warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Policy Relevance Statement-When designing mental health interventions for conflict-affected persons, it is critically important to assess and integrate contextually specific experiences and local conceptions of healthy functioning. Findings from this study highlight the relevance of community-based programming that can facilitate social adaptation and link affected persons to formal mental health services. Programs that promote greater awareness and interaction among the general public and conflict-affected groups are also warranted.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and impulsive aggression are linked to transdiagnostic neurocognitive deficits. This includes impaired inhibitory control over inappropriate responses. Prior studies showed that inhibitory control can be improved by modulating the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in combination with inhibitory control training. However, its clinical potential remains unclear. We therefore aimed to replicate a tDCS-enhanced inhibitory control training in a clinical sample and test whether this reduces stress-related mental health symptoms. METHOD(S): In a preregistered double-blind randomized-controlled trial, 100 active-duty military personnel and post-active veterans with PTSD, anxiety, or impulsive aggression symptoms underwent a 5-session intervention where a stop-signal response inhibition training was combined with anodal tDCS over the right IFG for 20 min at 1.25 mA. Inhibitory control was evaluated with the emotional go/no-go task and implicit association test. Stress-related symptoms were assessed by self-report at baseline, post-intervention, and after 3-months and 1-year follow-ups. RESULT(S): Active relative to sham tDCS neither influenced performance during inhibitory control training nor on assessment tasks, and did also not significantly influence self-reported symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, impulsive aggression, or depression at post-assessment or follow-up. CONCLUSION(S): Our results do not support the idea that anodal tDCS over the right IFG at 1.25 mA enhances response inhibition training in a clinical sample, or that this tDCS-training combination can reduce stress-related symptoms. Applying different tDCS parameters or combining tDCS with more challenging tasks might provide better conditions to modulate cognitive functioning and stress-related symptoms.

N2  - AIM: To describe the levels of turnover intention, and to explore the mediating effects of work engagement and compassion fatigue on the relationship between resilience and turnover intention in dialysis nurses. METHOD(S): A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit 496 dialysis nurses in 25 tertiary hospitals in Sichuan province, China. Structural equation modeling technique was used to examine the mediating roles of work engagement and compassion fatigue on the association between resilience and turnover intention. RESULT(S): The prevalence of high and exceptionally high levels of turnover intention in dialysis nurses were 56.8% (282 nurses) and 8.7% (43 nurses), respectively. Resilience was a significant and direct contributor to work engagement (standardized direct effect = 0.62, p <.001) and compassion fatigue (standardized direct effect = -0.35, p <.001), respectively. However, resilience had no direct and significant effect on turnover intention (standardized direct effect = 0.15, p >.05). Work engagement and compassion fatigue had direct and significant effects on turnover intention (standardized direct effect = -0.40, p <.001; standard direct effect = 0.31, p <.001). Resilience affected turnover intention indirectly and significantly via the whole mediating effects of work engagement and compassion fatigue (standardized indirect effect = -0.36, p <.001). CONCLUSION(S): Higher resilience leads to lower turnover intention via enhancing work engagement and reducing compassion fatigue in dialysis nurses. Nursing policies should be established to promote resilience training, enhance work engagement and reduce compassion fatigue in order to alleviate turnover intention in dialysis nurses.Copyright © 2021 Japan Academy of Nursing Science.

N2  - When military veterans return from service many are in a state of reintegration from military to civilian life, a transition that can be difficult and stressful. Recent literature supports the use of human-animal interactions to reduce stress. To date there have been few studies that examine the health effects of interacting with dogs specifically in the veteran population. This project evaluated the effect of walking with a shelter dog on psychological and physiological stress indicators in veterans. A randomized repeated measures crossover study was employed. Veterans (n = 33) consented to participate in experimental (dog-walk: four weekly 30-min. sessions) and comparison (human-walk: four weekly 30-min. sessions) conditions. The setting was two animal shelters. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, perceived stress, and salivary cortisol, alpha-amylase (AA), and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed. Linear mixed models with random intercepts and repeated measurements nested within participants were used for separate analyses of each outcome. The results indicate responses to walking with a dog and a human from week 1 to week 4 were different depending on PTSD symptoms. Walking with a dog or another person led to decreases in cortisol among those with low PTSD symptom severity (p = 0.057 and p = 0.026, respectively). For individuals with high PTSD symptoms, walking with a dog did not significantly change levels of AA, but walking with a person did (p = 0.953 and p < 0.001, respectively). For individuals with lower PTSD symptom, AA did not change significantly (p > 0.05) for either type of walk. HRV data revealed a significant interaction (F(2, 458.74) = 3.505, p = 0.031] between the week number of the walk and dog presence. Average HRV increased for individuals with higher PTSD symptoms from week 1 to week 4 but decreased when they walked with a human. This study provides evidence that walking with a shelter dog affects psychological and physiological stress indicators in veterans. Additional measures and extended monitoring require creative strategies to engage participants after the intervention (e.g., walks) to facilitate assessment of peak responses. Future studies with a larger sample size in multiple shelters should be conducted to validate and extend the current results.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 ISAZ.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of caring for family members experiencing spiritual distress on Intensive Care Unit healthcare providers. DESIGN: A qualitative study involving interviews and focus groups between May 2016 and April 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Intensive care healthcare providers from nine teaching and three non-teaching Iunits across X, X. MEASUREMENTS: Transcribed data were analysed using interpretive description. FINDINGS: Forty-two participants variably described experiences of vicarious spiritual distress, along with coping strategies and outcomes related to these experiences. Vicarious spiritual distress was experienced as sorrow/distress, helplessness and preoccupation/rumination. Coping strategies were both adaptive (self-awareness/reflection, reframing/resiliency, team support/debriefing, self-care, accepting limitations) and maladaptive (compartmentalising/distancing, substance use). Lastly, the emotional burden of these experiences resulted in both favourable (satisfaction, appreciation) and unfavourable (moral distress, burnout, hopelessness) outcomes. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings describe the novel concept of vicarious spiritual distress as experienced by intensive care healthcare providers and highlight the importance of identifying effective ways to support these professionals throughout their careers to prevent unfavorable outcomes and the perpetuation of maladaptive coping strategies. The adaptive coping strategies described in this study may help inform wellness initiatives and resiliency training tailored to intensive care healthcare providers.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Traditional approaches to safety management in health care have focused primarily on counting errors and understanding how things go wrong. Resilient Health Care (RHC) provides an alternative complementary perspective of learning from incidents and understanding how, most of the time, work is safe. The aim of this review was to identify how RHC is conceptualised, described and interpreted in the published literature, to describe the methods used to study RHC, and to identify factors that develop RHC. METHOD(S): Electronic searches of PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane databases were performed to identify relevant peer-reviewed studies, and a hand search undertaken for studies published in books that explained how RHC as a concept has been interpreted, what methods have been used to study it, and what factors have been important to its development. Studies were evaluated independently by two researchers. Data was synthesised using a thematic approach. RESULT(S): Thirty-six studies were included; they shared similar descriptions of RHC which was the ability to adjust its functioning prior to, during, or following events and thereby sustain required operations under both expected and unexpected conditions. Qualitative methods were mainly used to study RHC. Two types of data sources have been used: direct (e.g. focus groups and surveys) and indirect (e.g. observations and simulations) data sources. Most of the tools for studying RHC were developed based on predefined resilient constructs and have been categorised into three categories: performance variability and Work As Done, cornerstone capabilities for resilience, and integration with other safety management paradigms. Tools for studying RHC currently exist but have yet to be fully implemented. Effective team relationships, trade-offs and health care 'resilience' training of health care professionals were factors used to develop RHC. CONCLUSION(S): Although there was consistency in the conceptualisation of RHC, methods used to study and the factors used to develop it, several questions remain to be answered before a gold standard strategy for studying RHC can confidently be identified. These include operationalising RHC assessment methods in multi-level and diverse settings and developing, testing and evaluating interventions to address the wider safety implications of RHC amidst organisational and institutional change.

N2  - Background. Depressive and anxiety disorders occur at very high rates among medical students. For instance, an international review and meta-analysis estimated the overall pooled crude prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms at 27.2%. However, South African (SA) data are very limited. Objectives. To determine rates of depression and anxiety among medical students and to examine the associations with various sociodemographic variables (biological sex, gender identity, household income, ethnicity, and clinical v. pre-clinical students). We also examined whether the 'mini-semester' of 2017 resulting from the 2016 'Fees Must Fall' student protests was associated with increased depression/anxiety. Methods. The study was a cross-sectional electronic survey conducted in the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, using an anonymous, self-administered online questionnaire. The questionnaire included basic sociodemographic questions, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results. The sample consisted of 473 medical students, 333 (70.4%) female and 140 (29.6%) male. Based on ethnic self-identification, 165 (35.6%) were black, 144 (31.1%) white, 88 (19%) coloured, 52 (11.2%) Indian and 8 (1.7%) Asian. There were 239 pre-clinical students (50.5%) and 234 clinical students (49.5%). Of the sample, 36.4% were above the cut-off for major depressive disorder and 45.9% for anxiety disorder. Reported rates of disorders diagnosed by a health professional were 25.0% for depressive disorder and 20.5% for anxiety disorder, and 28.1% of all students were receiving psychotropic medication. Female sex was associated with both depression (prevalence ratio (PR) 3.7; p<0.001) and anxiety diagnoses (PR 4.7; p<0.001). None of the other sociodemographic characteristics showed significant associations. Interestingly, students who undertook the 2017 mini-semester showed an increased rate of depression (PR 2.1; p<0.05) and anxiety diagnoses (PR 2.1; p<0.05). Conclusions. Nearly one in four students reported depression/anxiety diagnoses and were on psychotropic medication, significantly more than age-based expectations. Even more screened positive for risk of depression/anxiety. Our findings indicate that medical students, particularly females, are at a significantly increased risk of depression and anxiety disorders. Results suggest that the 2016 student protests may have had a direct impact on the mental state of students. Multidisciplinary efforts should be targeted at initiatives to strengthen mental wellbeing and institutional culture around mental health. These efforts may help build resilience in the next generation of health professionals in SA ahead of work in an overburdened health and health education system.Copyright © 2019 South African Medical Association.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: What effect does cancer treatment have on levels of spontaneous selfish fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) point mutations in human sperm? SUMMARY ANSWER: Chemotherapy and radiotherapy do not increase levels of spontaneous FGFR2 mutations in sperm but, unexpectedly, highly-sterilizing treatments dramatically reduce the levels of the disease-associated c.755C > G (Apert syndrome) mutation in sperm. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Cancer treatments lead to short-term increases in gross DNA damage (chromosomal abnormalities and DNA fragmentation) but the long-term effects, particularly at the single nucleotide resolution level, are poorly understood. We have exploited an ultra-sensitive assay to directly quantify point mutation levels at the FGFR2 locus. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: 'Selfish' mutations are disease-associated mutations that occur spontaneously in the sperm of most men and their levels typically increase with age. Levels of mutations at c.752-755 of FGFR2 (including c.755C > G and c.755C > T associated with Apert and Crouzon syndromes, respectively) in semen post-cancer treatment from 18 men were compared to levels in pre-treatment samples from the same individuals (n = 4) or levels in previously screened population controls (n = 99). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cancer patients were stratified into four different groups based on the treatments they received and the length of time for spermatogenesis recovery. DNA extracted from semen samples was analysed using a previously established highly sensitive assay to identify mutations at positions c.752-755 of FGFR2. Five to ten micrograms of semen genomic DNA was spiked with internal controls for quantification purposes, digested with MboI restriction enzyme and gel extracted. Following PCR amplification, further MboI digestion and a nested PCR with barcoding primers, samples were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Mutation levels were determined relative to the spiked internal control; in individuals heterozygous for a nearby common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), mutations were phased to their respective alleles. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Patients treated with moderately-sterilizing alkylating regimens and who recovered spermatogenesis within <3 years after therapy (Group 3, n = 4) or non - alkylating chemotherapy and/or low gonadal radiation doses (Group 1, n = 4) had mutation levels similar to untreated controls. However, patients who had highly-sterilizing alkylating treatments (i.e. >5 years to spermatogenesis recovery) (Group 2, n = 7) or pelvic radiotherapy (Group 4, n = 3) exhibited c.755C > G mutation levels at or below background. Two patients (A and B) treated with highly-sterilizing alkylating agents demonstrated a clear reduction from pre-treatment levels; however pre-treatment samples were not available for the other patients with low mutation levels. Therefore, although based on their age we would expect detectable levels of mutations, we cannot exclude the possibility that these patients also had low mutation levels pre-treatment. In three patients with low c.755C > G levels at the first timepoint post-treatment, we observed increasing mutation levels over time. For two such patients we could phase the mutation to a nearby polymorphism (SNP) and determine that the mutation counts likely originated from a single or a small number of mutational events. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was limited to 18 patients with different treatment regimens; for nine of the 18 patients, samples from only one timepoint were available. Only 12 different de novo substitutions at the FGFR2 c.752-755 locus were assessed, two of which are known to be disease associated. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our data add to the body of evidence from epidemiological studies and experimental data in humans suggesting that male germline stem cells are resilient to the accumulation of spontaneous mutations. Collectively, these data should provide physicians and health-care professionals with reassuring experimental-based evidence for counselling of male cancer patients contemplating their reproductive options several years after treatment. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This work was primarily supported by grants from the Wellcome (grant 091182 to AG and AOMW; grant 102 731 to AOMW), the University of Oxford Medical Sciences Division Internal Fund (grant 0005128 to GJM and AG), the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Biomedical Research Centre Programme (to AG) and the US National Institutes of Health (to MLM).

N2  - Objectives: To estimate and assess the prevalence and predictors of illness anxiety disorder among Saudi medical students in western Saudi Arabia. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2017 to March 2018 at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A self-administered questionnaire was applied. The questionnaire is composed of demographic data, the short version of the Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI), the Medical Student's Disease (MSD) perception and distress scale and history of a visit to a physician in the past 6 months. Result(s): Two hundred and seventy-one Saudi medical students participated; 71% were males and 53% were less than 22 years old. The participants represented all academic years, with 54% in their 4th, 5th, and 6th years. Illness anxiety disorder was identified in 17% of the participants. Younger students and those with a history of a physician's visit within the past 6 months were more likely to have illness anxiety disorder (OR=2.31, 95% CI= 1.16, 4.60; OR=2.46, 95% CI=1.25, 4.84). Conclusion(s): The prevalence of illness anxiety disorder among Saudi medical students is comparable to similar recent studies. Student counseling programs highlighting coping techniques, especially during the early study years, should be implemented.Copyright © 2019 Saudi Arabian Armed Forces Hospital. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives: First-responder mental health, especially in Canada, has been a topic of increasing interest given the high incidence of poor mental health, mental illness, and suicide among this cohort. Although research generally suggests that resiliency and stigma reduction programs can directly and indirectly affect mental health, little research has examined this type of training in first responders. The current paper examines the efficacy of the Road to Mental Readiness for First Responders program (R2MR), a resiliency and anti-stigma program. Method(s): The program was tested using a pre-post design with a 3-month follow-up in 5 first-responder groups across 16 sites. Result(s): A meta-analytic approach was used to estimate the overall effects of the program on resiliency and stigma reduction. Our results indicate that R2MR was effective at increasing participants' perceptions of resiliency and decreasing stigmatizing attitudes at the pre-post review, which was mostly maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Conclusion(s): Both quantitative and qualitative data suggest that the program helped to shift workplace culture and increase support for others.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Objective: We investigated the efficacy of epilepsy nurses on satisfaction with counseling about epilepsy in a randomized, controlled, prospective trial. Method(s): Patients with epilepsy treated by neurologists in outpatient clinics were consecutively enrolled and randomly allocated to either the epilepsy nurse (EN) group (n = 92) or the control group (n = 95). Patients in the EN group were advised according to their needs by epilepsy nurses. The control group received routine care without additional counseling. The EN group completed the questionnaires before the first consultation (T1) and 6 months later (T2); the control group completed the questionnaires twice with an interval of 6 months. Primary outcome measure was satisfaction of patients with information and support. Secondary outcome measures were satisfaction with patient-doctor relationship, organization of treatment, epilepsy knowledge, coping, and restrictions in daily life. Anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and global Quality of Life (item from QOLIE-31) were also assessed. Statistical analysis included generalized estimating equation (GEE) and nonparametric tests. Result(s): Satisfaction with information and support improved significantly in the EN group compared to the control group (GEE, interaction group x time, p = 0.001). In addition, Epilepsy Knowledge (p = 0.014) and Coping (subscale Information Seeking) (p = 0.023) improved. Increase in satisfaction with counseling was dependent on patients' needs for information and on the amount of received information (Jonckheere-Terpstra test, p < 0.001). No differences between the groups were observed on other epilepsy-specific scales. Significance: A reliable questionnaire for satisfaction with epilepsy care has been developed. Epilepsy nurses improve the satisfaction of patients with counseling and information about epilepsy and concomitant problems.Copyright © 2016 International League Against Epilepsy.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Post-traumatic stress disorder occurs in people exposed to life-threatening trauma. GPs may be seeing more patients with post-traumatic stress disorder as military personnel return from overseas deployments. The condition can present in various ways. To reduce the likelihood of missed or delayed diagnosis GPs can screen at-risk populations. A comprehensive assessment is recommended. Specialist referral may be required, particularly if there are other mental health problems. Trauma-focused psychological therapies should be offered as the first line of treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. Usually 8-12 sessions are needed for a therapeutic effect. If drug treatment is needed, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the first line. Other drugs used in post-traumatic stress disorder include antipsychotics, anticonvulsants and prazosin.Copyright © 2015, Australian Government Publishing Service. All rights reserved.

T1  - Effectiveness of a self-help manual on the promotion of resilience in individuals with depression in Thailand: A randomised controlled trial
A1  - Songprakun W.
A1  - McCann T.V. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: The prevalence of depression is increasing markedly in Thailand. One way of helping people with depression is to increase their resilience; good resilience is associated with positive outcomes in depression. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a self-help manual on the resilience levels of individuals with depression living in the community in Chiang Mai Province in northern Thailand. Method(s): Fifty-six participants with a diagnosis of moderate depression were assigned randomly to either an intervention (n = 27) or control (n = 29) group by means of independent random allocation, using computer generated random numbers. Fifty-four completed the study (two were excluded shortly after baseline data collection), so an available case analysis was undertaken. The intervention group were given a self-help manual and continued to receive standard care and treatment, while the control group continued to receive standard care and treatment. Both groups were also given a short weekly telephone call from a researcher. Participants were assessed at three time points: baseline (Week 0), immediate post-test (Week 8), and follow-up (Week 12). Data were collected between October 2007 and April 2008. Result(s): The findings showed statistically significant differences between the intervention and the control group, and within the intervention group, in their resilience levels. Simple main effects analyses of group within time showed a significant difference between both groups at follow-up (p = 0.001), with the intervention group having a higher resilience score than the control group. Simple main effect of time within the intervention group showed a significant increase in resilience scores from baseline to post-test time points (p < 0.001), from baseline to follow-up (p < 0.001), but not from post-test to follow-up (p = 0.298). Conclusion(s): The findings provide preliminary evidence supporting the use of bibliotherapy for increasing resilience in people with moderate depression in a Thai context. Bibliotherapy is straightforward to use, and an easily accessible addition to the standard approach to promoting recovery. It is incorporated readily as an adjunct to the work of mental health nurses and other professionals in promoting resilience and enhancing recovery in people with moderate depression in the community.

N2  - Background: Psychosocial stress caused by war, ongoing conflict, lack of security, and restricted access to resources promotes mental suffering and diseases in many resource-poor countries. In an exemplary setting, the present study compares the efficacy of psychosocial counselling with routine pharmacological treatment in a randomised trial in Mazar-e-Sharif (Afghanistan). Method(s): Help seeking Afghan women (N = 61), who were diagnosed with mental health symptoms by local physicians either received routine medical treatment (treatment as usual) or psychosocial counselling (5-8 sessions) following a specifically developed manualised treatment protocol. Primary outcome measures were symptoms of depression and anxiety assessed before treatment and at follow-up using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Secondary outcome measures were psychosocial stressors and coping mechanisms. Result(s): At 3-month follow-up, psychosocial counselling patients showed high improvements with respect to the severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety. In addition, they reported a reduction of psychosocial stressors and showed an enhancement of coping strategies. At the same time, the severity of symptoms, the quantity of psychosocial stressors and coping mechanisms did not improve in patients receiving routine medical treatment. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that psychosocial counselling can be an effective treatment for mental illnesses even for those living in ongoing unsafe environments.Trial registrationNCT01155687.

T1  - Non-invasive interventions for improving well-being and quality of life in patients with lung cancer
A1  - Rueda J.-R.
A1  - Sola I.
A1  - Pascual A.
A1  - Subirana Casacuberta M. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Background: This is an updated version of the original review published in Issue 4, 2004 of The Cochrane Library. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. Despite advances in treatment, the outlook for the majority of patients remains grim and most face a pessimistic future accompanied by sometimes devastating effects on emotional and psychological health. Although chemotherapy is accepted as an effective treatment for advanced lung cancer, the high prevalence of treatment-related side effects as well the symptoms of disease progression highlight the need for high-quality palliative and supportive care to minimise symptom distress and to promote quality of life. Objective(s): To assess the effectiveness of non-invasive interventions delivered by healthcare professionals in improving symptoms, psychological functioning and quality of life in patients with lung cancer. Search Method(s): We ran a search in February 2011 to update the original completed review. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (accessed through PubMed), EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, British Nursing Index and Archive (accessed through Ovid) and reference lists of relevant articles; we also contacted authors. Selection Criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of non-invasive interventions in improving well-being and quality of life in patients diagnosed with lung cancer. Data Collection and Analysis: Two authors independently assessed relevant studies for inclusion. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment of relevant studies was performed by one author and checked by a second author. Main Result(s): Fifteen trials were included, six of which were added in this update. Three trials of a nursing intervention to manage breathlessness showed benefit in terms of symptom experience, performance status and emotional functioning. Four trials assessed structured nursing programmes and found positive effects on delay in clinical deterioration, dependency and symptom distress, and improvements in emotional functioning and satisfaction with care. Three trials assessed the effect of different psychotherapeutic, psychosocial and educational interventions in patients with lung cancer. One trial assessing counselling showed benefit for some emotional components of the illness but findings were not conclusive. One trial examined the effects of coaching sensory self monitoring and reporting on pain-related variables and found that although coaching increases the amount of pain data communicated to providers by patients with lung cancer, the magnitude of the effect is small and does not lead to improved efficacy of analgesics prescribed for each patient's pain level. One trial compared telephone-based sessions of either caregiver-assisted coping skills training (CST) or education/support involving the caregiver and found that patients in both treatment conditions showed improvements in pain, depression, quality of life and self efficacy. Two trials assessed exercise programmes; one found a beneficial effect on self empowerment and the other study showed an increase in quadriceps strength but no significant changes for any measure of quality of life. One trial of nutritional interventions found positive effects for increasing energy intake, but no improvement in quality of life. Two small trials of reflexology showed some positive but short-lasting effects on anxiety and pain intensity. The main limitations of the studies included were the variability of the interventions assessed and the approaches to measuring the considered outcomes, and the lack of data reported in the trials regarding allocation of patients to treatment groups and blinding. Authors' conclusions: Nurse follow-up programmes and interventions to manage breathlessness may produce beneficial effects. Counselling may help patients cope more effectively with emotional symptoms, but the evidence is not conclusive. Other psychotherapeutic, psychosocial and educational interventions can play some role in improving patients' quality of life. Exercise programmes and nutritional interventions have not shown relevant and lasting improvements of quality of life. Reflexology may have some beneficial effects in the short term.Copyright © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Cancer patients are at heightened risk of suicide. Clinical correlates of suicidal ideation in advanced cancer patients were examined to identify those at risk and to inform the development of interventions to reduce suicidal ideation in this vulnerable group. METHOD(S): Coping with Cancer (CwC) is an NCI- and NIMH-funded multiinstitutional investigation examining psychosocial influences on the quality of life and care of advanced cancer patients. Baseline face-to-face interviews that assessed mental and physical functioning, coping, spirituality, and use of mental health services were conducted with 700 advanced cancer patients. RESULT(S): Compared with patients without suicidal ideation, the 8.9% of patients who reported suicidal thoughts were more likely to be white and report no affiliation with an organized religion (p < 0.05). Adjusted analyses revealed that cancer patients who met criteria for current panic disorder (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 3.24 [1.01-10.4]) and posttraumatic stress disorder (3.97 [1.13-14.1]), who accessed mental health services (3.70 [2.07-6.67]), particularly psychotherapy (2.62 [1.20-5.71]), who were not feeling well physically, and who lacked a sense of self-efficacy, spirituality, and being supported were more likely than others to report thoughts of suicide (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Advanced cancer patients who report suicidal thoughts are more likely to meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder and panic disorder, feel unsupported, lack a religious affiliation, spirituality, and a sense of self-efficacy, and experience more physical distress. Palliative care interventions that promote a sense of self-efficacy, spirituality, and support while minimizing physical distress may offer promise for reducing suicidal thoughts in this at-risk group.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The effects of different extreme events were studied in relation to two types of stress - combat (military) stress and stress imposed by the Chernobyl nuclear power station accident. Totals of 30 combatants and 33 clean-up workers were investigated and treated. The characteristics of the initial stage of stress reactions and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed in terms of the major diagnostic criteria in each group. The overall conclusions were: that the responses to different stresses involved the development of similar pathological states, including all the main symptoms of PTSD. However, these were accompanied by significant phenomenological differences at the level of syndromes depending on the nature of the stressors (traumatic events). This report provides detailed assessment of the questions of the complex treatment of patients using psychotherapy and medications, as well as approaches to rehabilitation and social support. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

T1  - Music's relevance for pediatric cancer patients: a constructivist and mosaic research approach

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Purpose: Music is important in most children's lives. To advance efficacious pediatric supportive care, it is necessary to understand young cancer patients' thoughts about music. Concern about inviting unwell children to express opinions has resulted in scant research examining their views. "Mosaic" research examines children's experiences through investigating multiple perspectives which inform a "co-constructed meaning." This study examines pediatric cancer patients' and their parents' perspectives about music and music therapy's role in the children's lives. Material(s) and Method(s): Children were receiving care at three hospitals with the Paediatric Integrative Cancer Service in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. A constructivist research approach with grounded theory design was applied. Children up to 14 years old with cancer and parents participated. Data included transcripts from semi-structured research interviews and observations of children's music behaviors. Qualitative inter-rater reliability was integrated. Findings were compared with music therapists' perspectives examined elsewhere. Result(s): Interviews were conducted with 26 patients, median age 5.7 years, and 28 parents. Data "saturation" was achieved. A substantive grounded theory emerged: Children's adverse cancer experiences are often alleviated by music usages. Broader family, social, and electronic musical interactions also promote children's resilience and "normal" development. Music therapy and associated programs often, but not always, alleviate children's distress. Positive effects may carry over into children's home lives and vicariously support families. Conclusion(s): Health professionals should consider ways to assist parents who are often using music to support children with cancer. Hospitals can promote pediatric cancer patients' resilience by providing music-based support services, including music therapy, and reducing unwanted stressful sounds. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Purpose: To test empirically the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) recovery model. Method(s): Two hundred and four attendants aged 18-60, with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, from two participating outpatient clinics were interviewed with a number of inventories, including health-related quality of life measure (WHOQOL-BREF (HK)). Canonical correlation analysis was performed on two sets of variables (SAMHSA recovery components and QoL domain scores). Result(s): There were significant correlations between most recovery components proposed in the SAMHSA recovery statement and the health-related quality of life measure. Age, duration of untreated psychosis, the degree of social support, the interaction of singlehood and the number of confidants, engagement in competitive careers, and the duration of participation in community support services were all found to be important predictors. Conclusion(s): The SAMHSA consensus statement appeared to contain valid concepts for Chinese subjects. It presented new challenges for psychiatric rehabilitation and reminded the policy makers that there is much more psychiatric rehabilitation can achieve beyond symptom control and patient management. It also demonstrated that resolve and the commitment of resources to combat stigma, develop resilience, and foster patient empowerment were very much needed in Hong Kong and perhaps in Asia and elsewhere. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

N2  - Introduction Despite rapidly growing academic and policy interest in health system resilience, the empirical literature on this topic remains small and focused on macrolevel effects arising from single shocks. To better understand health system responses to multiple shocks, we conducted an in-depth case study using qualitative system dynamics. We focused on routine childhood vaccination delivery in Lebanon in the context of at least three shocks overlapping to varying degrees in space and time: large-scale refugee arrivals from neighbouring Syria; COVID-19; and an economic crisis. Methods Semistructured interviews were performed with 38 stakeholders working at different levels in the system. Interview transcripts were analysed using purposive text analysis to generate individual stakeholder causal loop diagrams (CLDs) mapping out relationships between system variables contributing to changes in coverage for routine antigens over time. These were then combined using a stepwise process to produce an aggregated CLD. The aggregated CLD was validated using a reserve set of interview transcripts. Results Various system responses to shocks were identified, including demand promotion measures such as scaling-up community engagement activities and policy changes to reduce the cost of vaccination to service users, and supply side responses including donor funding mobilisation, diversification of service delivery models and cold chain strengthening. Some systemic changes were introduced-particularly in response to refugee arrivals-including task-shifting to nurse-led vaccine administration. Potentially transformative change was seen in the integration of private sector clinics to support vaccination delivery and depended on both demand side and supply side changes. Some resilience-promoting measures introduced following earlier shocks paradoxically increased vulnerability to later ones. Conclusion Flexibility in financing and human resource allocation appear key for system resilience regardless of the shock. System dynamics offers a promising method for ex ante modelling of ostensibly resilience-strengthening interventions under different shock scenarios, to identify-And safeguard against-unintended consequences.Copyright © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: What are the pre-existing medical conditions and lifestyle behaviours of women with and without PCOS during the preconception period? SUMMARY ANSWER: During the preconception period, medical conditions of obesity, depression, anxiety, and a history of infertility were more highly prevalent in women with than without PCOS, and more women with than without PCOS were engaged in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women with PCOS are predisposed to infertility and pregnancy complications. Optimizing preconception medical health and lifestyle behaviours can improve maternal and pregnancy outcomes but, to the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the preconception medical conditions and lifestyle behaviours of women with PCOS. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE DURATION: This is a cross-sectional study on 942 women with PCOS and 7024 women without PCOS, aged 24-30 years from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health, an ongoing, national survey-based prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The current study analysed self-reported data from Survey 6 collected in 2019 of the cohort of women born between 1989 and 1995. Explored outcomes included BMI, pre-existing medical conditions, and modifiable lifestyle behaviours, including smoking, recreational drug use, alcohol intake, and physical activity level, during the preconception period. Differences between subgroups were tested using Student's t-test, v2 test, or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. The associations of pregnancy intention with medical conditions and lifestyle behaviours were examined using logistic regression. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Obesity, depression, anxiety, and infertility were highly prevalent in women actively planning for pregnancy. Among women with PCOS, the prevalence of obesity was 47.02%, followed by depression at 32.70%, anxiety at 39.62%, and infertility at 47.17%. Conversely among women without PCOS, the corresponding prevalence was lower, at 22.33% for obesity, 18.98% for depression, 23.93% for anxiety, and 16.42% for infertility. In women actively planning for pregnancy, only those without PCOS demonstrated a lower prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours compared to non-planning women. The prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours was similar in women with PCOS regardless of their pregnancy intentions. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that only moderate/high stress with motherhood/children (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.31, 95% CI 1.60-6.85) and history of infertility (adjusted OR 9.67, 95% CI 5.02-18.64) were significantly associated with active pregnancy planning in women with PCOS. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The findings were based on self-reported data. The cohort of women surveyed may have a higher level of education than women in the community, therefore our findings may underestimate the true prevalence of pre-existing medical conditions and lifestyle challenges faced by the broader population. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: A higher proportion of women with than without PCOS had pre-existing medical conditions and engaged in potentially modifiable unhealthy lifestyle behaviours during preconception despite their risk for subfertility and pregnancy complications. Healthcare professionals play a pivotal role in guiding this high-risk group of women during this period, offering counselling, education, and support for the adoption of healthy lifestyles to improve fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and intergenerational health.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Purpose of Review: Stress, burnout, and sleep disorders significantly impact health professionals during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reviews the scoping strategies to inform human resource management and administration. These approaches can help health professionals overcome challenges associated with sleep disorders during and after the pandemic. Recent Findings: The review of existing literature discovered a reciprocal relationship between stress, burnout, and sleep disorders during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, which is associated with an interplay of physiological and psychological factors among health professionals. Effective coping strategies for sleep disorders involve both personal and organizational efforts to address and mitigate these issues. Summary: Female health professionals have been identified as more vulnerable to sleep disorders, stress, and burnout, primarily due to hormonal influences. However, there is an increasing concern for male counterparts as well. Effective coping strategies for health professionals include enhancing emotional resilience, fostering altruism through reflective counseling, employing sleep medications, and establishing organizational justice.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - Introduction: Burnout is "Chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed." Professional quality of life (PQL) includes work related experiences of compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue. Healthcare providers (HCPs) are highly susceptible to burnout and compassion fatigue due to their demanding work, which lowers PQL. Burnout leads to poor care, medical errors, and patient safety across healthcare disciplines. Yoga has been shown to improve resilience, reduce stress, and increase self-compassion and psycho-physiological coherence. This study compared HCPs in a mHealth-aided 12-week yoga-based meditation and breath intervention to waitlist controls for HCP burnout and PQL at a north Indian tertiary care hospital. Method(s): This was randomized waitlist-controlled trial. Total 98 HCPs (62 males and 36 females) with an average age of 28.26+/-3.547years were enrolled consecutively from March 2021 to November 2022. Randomization was done with opaque sealed envelopes numbered in a computer-generated sequence. The experimental group (n =49) received 12 online weekly yoga sessions and performed daily home practice (6days a week). The waitlisted control group (n =49) continued their daily routine. Maslach's burnout inventory (MBI), professional quality of life (PQL) and anthropometric measurements were assessed at baseline and after 12weeks. Result(s): After 12weeks, the MBI outcomes of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment showed a highly significant difference between the two groups (p <0.001). PQL outcomes of compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary trauma also differed significantly (p <0.001). Within group analysis showed that MBI and PQL outcomes improved significantly (p <0.001) for the experimental group after 12weeks. Conclusion(s): The current study contributes to the existing evidence on the effectiveness of Yoga in managing stress and developing resilience among doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals. Integrating yoga into healthcare settings is crucial for addressing the detrimental impact of burnout on decision-making and promoting positive patient outcomes. mHealth technologies have the potential to enhance the user-friendliness of yoga-based interventions by personalizing the practice space and time. Yoga-based interventions and mHealth technologies can effectively address physician burnout, in a simple and implementable manner.Copyright © 2023 Bhardwaj, Pathania, Bahurupi, Kanchibhotla, Harsora and Rathaur.

N2  - Aim: Healthcare professionals are at increased risk of burnout, primarily due to workplace-related stressors. The COVID-19 pandemic has further increased this risk. Different interventions exist with varying degrees of effectiveness; little is reported on the content and implementation of such programs. This review fills this gap, with attention to recent programs using digital components. Method(s): PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar were searched between January 24th and 28th, 2022, limited to the last 5years (>=2017). Articles were included if they (1) focused on stress reduction or burnout prevention for nurses and medical doctors within workplace health promotion for nurses or medical doctors, (2) included a digital program component, (3) were conducted in high-income country contexts, and (4) were clinical studies published in English or German. Data was extracted using a priori designed spreadsheets. A group of at least 2 authors at each stage carried out the screening, selection, and data extraction. Result(s): The search strategy identified 153 articles, all except 7 were excluded. Two studies were conducted in the USA, two in Spain, one in the Netherlands, Poland, and Korea each. Four studies used a randomized study design, all but one had a control group. A wide range of outcome measures was used. The types of interventions included an adapted mindfulness-based stress reduction program combined with aspects of behavioral therapies, cognitive behavioral therapy, or acceptance and commitment therapy. The digital components used were apps (4 studies), a digital platform, blended learning, and a web-based intervention (1 study each). Six studies focused on individual interventions, one included organizational interventions. Conclusion(s): Despite an acute burnout crisis in the healthcare sector, only seven recent interventions were found that integrated digital components. Several problems emerged during the implementation of the interventions that made it clear that organizational support is urgently needed for successful implementation. Although interventions for stress reduction and burnout prevention should combine individual and organizational measures to be as successful as possible, this was only partially the case in one of the intervention programs. The results of this scoping review can be used to further develop or optimize stress and burnout prevention programs.Copyright © 2023 Adam, Berschick, Schiele, Bogdanski, Schroter, Steinmetz, Koch, Sehouli, Reschke, Stritter, Kessler and Seifert.

N2  - Introduction: This study investigates correlates of intimate relationship satisfaction among investigators of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Previous research has shown that exposure to CSAM content can negatively impact investigators' emotional wellbeing, but little is known about its association with their intimate relationships. Method(s): The study included 500 participants who were police investigators, forensic examiners, and other professionals connected with the criminal justice system in the United States that are exposed to CSAM as part of their profession. The study collected data through an anonymous survey administered via the Qualtrics online survey system. Result(s): The findings reveal that higher levels of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder are associated with lower relationship satisfaction among CSAM investigators. Additionally, group connectedness is positively related to relationship satisfaction for both men and women. Parent investigators also reported lower relationship satisfaction, suggesting unique challenges faced by this subgroup. Exposure to varying types of CSAM content was not significantly related to lower relationship satisfaction. This study highlights the association between depressive symptoms and PTSD with relationship satisfaction among CSAM investigators, emphasizing the role of group connectedness in promoting positive outcomes for both male and female investigators. Discussion(s): Recognizing the association between depressive symptoms and PTSD with relationship satisfaction can guide interventions and support services for investigators, promoting group connectedness and addressing mental health concerns to enhance resilience and effectiveness in combating child exploitation.Copyright © 2023 Gewirtz-Meydan, O'Brien and Mitchell.

N2  - Background: Infective Endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening disease with increasing incidence worldwide. An important aspect in a patient's course of illness is having a close and understanding caregiver. Receiving support from a partner or spouse has been found to be associated with increased survival and lower recurrence of heart diseases. Likewise, the caregiver may be able to experience positive emotions and personal growth by being an important part of the patient's course of illness. Previous studies have explored patients' and caregivers' experiences with participation during the patient's course of illness. To our knowledge, these perspectives have not yet been studied in patients with IE and their caregivers. Purpose(s): The purpose of this study was to explore and elucidate patients with IE and their caregivers' experiences with each other's participation during the patient's course of illness including hospitalization and recovery at home. Methodology: The design was a holistic single-case study, where patients with IE and their caregivers were the target of interest. The empirical data was collected using qualitative, semi-structured dyadic interviews where the participants were interviewed in pairs. Theory-driven and data-driven coding was used as the analytical tools in the analysis of the data. Result(s): The empirical data suggest that social support plays a significant role in the participants' lives and course of illness, in which emotional support, physiological and practical assistance, as well as attitude transmission accounted for the greatest sources of impact. Important factors to the psychological well-being of participants were spending time with family members and maintaining a positive outlook on life. In light of theories of coping in social psychology, some participants reported using emotion-focused coping, problem-focused coping and protective buffering coping, whilst others did not use these. The majority of the caregivers reported that the course of illness did not have an impact on their working life and social relations, while some stated that it had a negative impact on their work, finances, mental and physical energy and social relations. An additional insight was given as the participants shared their thoughts on a need for psychological counseling and their experiences with compassionate healthcare professionals. Conclusion(s): The study concludes that the participation of patients with IE and their caregivers in the course of illness played an important and positive role in their lives. As such, it could be advised that healthcare professionals should focus more on how patients and their caregivers cope both individually and together in the course of illness. Understanding their perspectives could have implications on how healthcare professionals plan health measures to improve outcomes for both the patient and the caregiver.

N2  - Purpose: The general objective was to evaluate the factors influencing the onset of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in firefighters in Lome. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study of the case-control and content analysis of the discourse relating to firefighters and their experience in the face of psychotraumatic interventions in Lome. This study was carried out from June 1 to 14, 2021. Two groups were formed: one group consisted of firefighters who presented with PTSD defined by a score greater than 51 on the QSPT with the presence of the 8 DSM V criteria; a control group made up of firefighters who did not present with PTSD. One case was matched to a control. Result(s): The firefighters were divided into 2 groups depending on whether or not they had presented with PTSD; hence 40 cases were matched to 40 controls. The male gender predominated in the case group at 75%; as in the control group, at 77.5%. The M/F sex ratio was 3/1 in the cases. Overall, the mean age was 32.4 +/- 6.1 years. With respect to personal vulnerability, being conscientious, perfectionist, they had probabilities P = 0 each and ORs respectively equal to 21.3 [2.3-10.4] and 6.2 [1.4-5]. Those who demonstrated a reluctance to make requests, fear of being criticized, and excessive submission to others had probabilities P = 0.0003 [1.3-4.9], P = 0.0009 [1.3-5.6] and P = 0 respectively, 0001 [1.4-4.9]. In terms of those experiencing trauma, both the feeling of a loss of control and that of being alone in facing situations constituted a significant risk for the onset of PTSD with P = 0 and OR = 21 [2.3-10.4]; P = 0.0001 and OR = 6.4 [1.4-4.3] respectively. In others, the desire to leave the profession, emotional exhaustion and alcohol consumption after the intervention constituted a significant risk factor in the occurrence of PTSD. Conclusion(s): The fact of being conscientious, with a feeling of loss of control during interventions, associated with the desire to leave the profession were the main risk factors linked to the occurrence of PTSD.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - Background Mental disorders among adolescents represent a high burden and early onset. They compromise their physical health, survival, and future potential. On the other hand, young people have inadequate access to essential health services in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to review school-based psychological interventions, contents, delivery, and evidence of effectiveness designed to treat depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress symptoms among adolescents and young adults aged 10-24. Method We searched articles on the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Science Direct from 17/10/2022 to 30/12/2022. Furthermore, relevant studies were searched from advanced google scholar, google and identified reference lists. We used MeSH browser for key words: psychological interventions, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder and lists of Sub-Saharan Africa countries. We combined words using standard Boolean operators (OR, AND). The quality of studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool and the results were presented as a narrative synthesis since the interventions were very heterogenous. Results Fourteen randomized controlled trials were included for systematic review and more than half (57.14%) were from Kenya and Nigeria. Common school-based psychological interventions were cognitive behavioral therapy and Shamiri interventions (an intervention that focuses on youths to cultivate a growth mindset, practice gratitude and take the value). More than half (57.14%) of the interventions were delivered by non-specialists like teachers, lay providers and community health workers. Nearly one-fifth of the interventions were used individual modality. School-based psychological interventions provided by non-specialists also produced a greater reduction in adolescents' depressive, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms compared to the control groups. Conclusion Cognitive behavioral therapy and Shamiri interventions were the common treatment delivered in school settings. The range of interventions could be effectively delivered by non- professionals that promote task-shifting of psychological interventions from very scarce mental health specialists in these countries.Copyright © 2023 Tareke et al.

N2  - There has been an increasing interest in primary prevention programmes developed to improve police officers' mental health. This meta-analysis synthesised the existing findings on psychological skills training for police personnel including resilience training and mindfulness-based training. Particularly, this study systematically assessed the effectiveness of training programmes on mental health outcomes including resilience, depression, anxiety and perceived stress. A comprehensive search of EBSCO, ProQuest and Web of Science was conducted for studies written in English from 1999 to 2022. Two independent researchers screened 5604 studies. Eligible studies are intervention studies with controlled trials that involved training programmes to improve participants' mental health and reported at least one of the following outcomes: resilience, depression, anxiety and perceived stress. The meta-analysis estimated standardised mean differences (SMDs) for each of the four outcomes. A total of 12 studies, involving 2298 police personnel from 8 countries, met the criteria for inclusion and quality assessment. The training programmes of the eligible studies varied in training approaches, duration, total sessions and followup periods. The results suggest that training programmes have a statistically significant moderate effect on depression (SMD=-0.47, 95% CI=-0.73 to -0.22) and anxiety (SMD=-0.40, 95% CI=-0.73 to -0.06), while the effects on resilience (SMD=1.03, 95% CI=-0.36 to 2.41) and perceived stress (SMD=-1.03, 95% CI=-2.15 to 0.08) are not statistically significant. This study highlights the role of primary prevention approaches in supporting officers' mental health by showing that training programmes are effective in mitigating the risk of depression and anxiety.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

N2  - Introduction and Aim: The most popular treatment for treating severe and irreversible renal failure is hemodialysis. Even under the greatest circumstances, getting used to kidney failure's consequences and the time spent on dialysis may be challenging. In addition to the 'lost time', the patient could feel less energetic.. This pilot research aims to assess the efficacy of video-assisted teaching on selective nurse-led clinical interventions to improve knowledge, physiological and psychological outcomes and reduce the symptom burden among patients undergoing hemodialysis. Material(s) and Method(s): Forty hemodialysis patients were recruited and randomly allocated to intervention (n = 20) and control groups (n = 20) using an evaluative pre-test and post-test repeated measure study design with the control group. Patients in the intervention group received intervention in terms of Watching a video clip (40 minutes)-the video consist of disease condition, hemodialysis, dietary habits, fluid restriction, sleep hygiene, meditation, and yoga techniques, for two weeks after pre-test, later practice session, and group discussion along with Individualised teaching and counseling session, finally a regular weekly follow up at dialysis unit, while the control group received only routine care. Result(s): In the intervention group there was a gradual increase in knowledge, coping and QoL (quality of life), reduction in stress and symptom burden, and physiological outcomes remain the same without much change. In the control group, they did not change the knowledge, physiological and psychological outcomes, and symptom burden in most of the patients. Conclusion(s): For enhancing knowledge, physiological and psychological results, and symptom load, nurse-led clinical treatments are helpful, safe, essential, natural therapies that may be carried out under supervision both during hemodialysis and at home. Nurse-led clinical interventions integrated into routine care shall lead to improvements in patients' life.Copyright © 2023, Indian Association of Biomedical Scientists. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic necessitated alternative methods to ensure the continuity of medical education. Our study explores the efficacy and acceptability of a digital continuous medical education initiative for medical residents during this challenging period. METHOD(S): From September to December 2020, 47 out of 60 enrolled trainee doctors participated in this innovative digital Continuous Medical Education (CME) approach. We utilized the Script Concordance Test to bolster clinical reasoning skills. Three simulation scenarios, namely Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), Advanced Life Support (ALS), and European Paediatric Life Support (EPLS), were transformed into interactive online sessions via ZoomTM. Participant feedback was also collected through a survey. RESULT(S): Consistent Script Concordance Testing (SCT) scores among participants indicated the effectiveness of the online training module. Feedback suggested a broad acceptance of this novel training approach. However, discrepancies observed between formative SCT scores, and summative Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQ) assessments highlighted areas for potential refinement. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings showcase the resilience and adaptability of medical education amidst challenges like the global pandemic. The success of methodologies such as SCT, endorsed by prestigious bodies like the European Resuscitation Council and the American Heart Association, suggests their potential in preparing health care professionals for emergent situations. This research offers valuable insights for shaping future online CME strategies.

N2  - The rise in online sexual exposure and solicitation among youth has heightened concerns. Youth, due to their limited socio-cognitive capacity, face greater risks of online sexual victimization compared to adults. Unwanted online sexual solicitation (UOSS) is a concerning aspect of sexual victimization, encompassing requests for unwanted sexual talks, activities, and sharing personal sexual information or images online. This study, based on target congruence theory, examined UOSS risk and protective factors using a national-representative youth sample in Taiwan. In 2020, 19,556 students (Grades 5-12, average age 15, 50% male) participated in the school-based online survey. Hierarchical linear regression was used to determine the significance of UOSS predictors. Findings revealed a 15.4% prevalence of UOSS. Accounting for age and gender, target-vulnerability variables (self-esteem, bullying victimization, psychological distress) and target-gratifiability variables (online self-disclosure, time spent online) significantly linked to UOSS. Youth who were bullied, had greater psychological distress and online self-disclosure, and increased Internet use were prone to UOSS, while self-esteem mitigated risks. Bullying victimization and online self-disclosure were the strongest correlates of UOSS in Taiwan's youth, followed by psychological distress, Internet usage, and self-esteem. In sum, this study enriches the understanding of UOSS among Taiwanese youth and suggests strategies to prevent online sexual victimization. Enhancing self-esteem, promoting social media education including online privacy and self-disclose, tackling bullying, addressing psychological distress, and furnishing relevant services are crucial preventive measures. These findings offer guidance to parents, educators, and health professionals for supervising and steering adolescents' online conduct, presenting an evidence-based framework to avert online sexual victimization.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with various health-related issues among nurses, including mental health problems such as moral injury. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between moral injury, general health, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and type of hospital among Iranian nurses working in different clinical settings during the COVID-19 outbreak. This cross-sectional study employed convenience sampling to recruit 334 nurses working in various clinical settings, including teaching and referral hospitals, in Kerman, Southeastern Iran from October 2021 to February 2022. The study used three measures, including the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and The Moral Injury Symptom Scale-Healthcare Professionals version (MISS-HP). Data analysis was conducted using SPSS25. The results indicated that moral injury was highly prevalent among Iranian nurses, with 47% of the participants reporting experiencing it. A total, 26.9% of the participants reported experiencing mental health disorders and 57.2% of the participants reported experiencing this disorder. Significant correlations were found between moral injury, general health, and PTSD. Specifically, moral injury levels were higher among female nurses with a history of mental disorders and those designated to treat all kinds of cases, compared to other participants. The results suggest that Iranian nurses are at a high risk of experiencing moral injury during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers and health authorities should establish related health educational programs, provide counseling services to promote general health, and pay particular attention to moral injury and PTSD. Additionally, nurse educators should integrate materials related to moral injury into the nursing curriculum.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The stress level among nurses is significantly high, which negatively affects the nurses' well-being and the quality of care provided to patients. The goal of this study was to measure the impact of implementing a resiliency training program on nurses. METHOD(S): A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was used to measure the impact of nurses' participation in a resiliency training program. The sample was recruited with the convenience sampling technique. Participants were allocated to groups according to their ability to attend all intervention sessions. A total of 137 participants completed all phases of the study. The study was conducted at a private hospital in Amman, Jordan. Data were collected at two time points, before the intervention and 1 week after the intervention. RESULT(S): Analysis of covariance was used to measure differences between groups after the intervention. The results indicated that there were statistically significant differences (p < .001) in resilience and stress levels between the groups after the intervention. CONCLUSION(S): Nurses in the intervention group showed a significant improvement in resilience scores and a significant reduction in stress scores. [J Contin Educ Nurs. 2023;54(12):581-588.].

N2  - Investigations about moral resilience and moral courage as mediators between moral distress and moral injury remain underreported among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses (n=412) from the Philippines were conveniently recruited via social media platforms and completed four self-report scales. The mediation model depicts that moral distress negatively impacts moral resilience and moral courage while positively affecting moral injury. Moral resilience and moral courage negatively impact moral injury, whereas moral resilience directly impacts moral courage. Finally, moral resilience and moral courage demonstrated a mediating effect between moral distress and moral injury. Findings indicate that healthcare organizations and nurse managers should nurture morally resilient and courageous therapeutic practices among frontline healthcare professionals to mitigate the negative effects of moral distress and moral injury.Copyright © 2023.

T1  - Resilience and Burnout in Pediatric Nurses in a Tertiary Children's Hospital
A1  - Waterworth S.
A1  - Grace A.-M. 
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - PURPOSE: To identify levels of burnout and resilience in pediatric nurses in a tertiary children's hospital in New Zealand. METHOD(S): Registered nurses providing pediatric care participated in a survey that included the Connor-Davison resilience scale and Maslach burnout scale. Nurses identified specific factors related to workload stress and strategies for enhancing resilience. RESULT(S): Participants were 197 nurses. We found low levels of resilience and high levels of burnout, although personal accomplishment scores were high. Nurses with <10 years of experience who worked >40 hours per week had significantly higher levels of emotional exhaustion compared with those who had >10 or more years of experience or worked <40 hours per week. There were differences in resilience levels based on years of practice and hours worked. Levels of depersonalisation were higher in different ethnic groups. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Burnout remains a significant problem for pediatric nurses. Job demands are likely to rise with the increased complexity of children with long-term conditions and families requiring support. Developing supportive plans to strengthen resilience and limit burnout are required. Further research is needed on how organizations can foster resilience practices and limit burnout, nurses feeling emotionally exhausted, reducing depersonalisation, and enhancing feelings of personal accomplishment. Nurse leaders can role-model positive resilience practices when engaging their teams in open conversations about preventing or reducing burnout.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Background: 30% of nurses experience burnout at any given time. Burnout is comprised of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization of clients, and feeling ineffective. COVID has exacerbated this already prevalent problem through longer shifts, shortages of resources, disrupted sleep, altered work/life balance, lack of child care, lack of personal protective equipment, fear of contracting/spreading COVID, social isolation, incivility, vaccine hesitancy, and the perception that providers are being asked to provide care that exceeds their level of comfort. Many in healthcare describe these added stressors as robbing them of the very sense of purpose that drives their sense of duty to their professions. Some of the usual buffers against burnout, such as family and social support, have been upended during the COVID pandemic. There is a well-established link between burnout and negative outcomes for providers including suicide, mental health issues and substance abuse. Ultimately, burnout leads to poor patient outcomes, decreased patient safety, lower productivity and increased medical errors. COVID-associated burnout has resulted in significant increases in staff turnover and provider shortages. Method(s): Our team sought to build effective interventions to impact burnout. Interventions to address burnout are often decided at high level administration levels and often miss the mark. We interviewed frontline nurses for their perspectives to inform effective interventions. Result(s): Administrators focused on monetary rewards and short-lived staff appreciation efforts. Interventions recommended by the nurses included: offering free resiliency training classes as part of a weekend "retreat", conducting educational sessions for healthcare administrators to impact culture change at healthcare institutions, survey all staff for their input into concrete methods to impact burnout on-site, offer support groups with ensured staff anonymity, build on-site stress relieving interventions, improve teamwork, lessen staffing shortages, equalize compensation with traveling nurses, and sustain interventions to demonstrate appreciation. Conclusion(s): Obtaining input from intended intervention recipients can help avoid ineffective interventions while promoting interventions expected to have the greatest impact. Asking for input alone can improve staff's sense of being valued and decrease burnout.

N2  - Background: Though it is generally accepted that the unique psychosocial environment of aging impacts geriatric patients' perioperative experience and post-operative outcomes, little is known about the experience of clinicians in assessing and mitigating psychosocial challenges (e.g., social support, coping mechanisms) during recovery. Method(s): Semi-structured interviews were conducted with an interdisciplinary group of clinicians at the University of California, San Francisco. Interviews explored the influence of psychological and social factors on the experience of older adults undergoing major surgery, focusing specifically on physical, cognitive, emotional, social, and psychological components. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using an inductive approach to identify themes. Result(s): Fifteen individual clinicians completed interviews (5 surgeons, 4 social workers, 3 primary care physicians, 2 nurses, and 1 physical therapist). Clinicians interviewed were 53% female, 60% white, 27% Asian, and 13% Hispanic, and the majority (73%) had over 10 years of work experience. Clinicians discussed three main themes: First, psychosocial strengths and vulnerabilities impact perioperative outcomes with "psychosocial supports, strength, resilience, cognitive reserve, a purpose to recover and move forward and live" all "playing into" a good recovery. Second, clinicians identified that they "are completely lacking a rigorous or standardized program for psychosocial support." Third, suggestions for improvement such as routinely addressing, and thereby normalizing, common psychosocial issues pre-operatively to help anticipate challenges that may arise during recovery. Conclusion(s): Clinicians caring for geriatric patients perioperatively lack specific and practical tools to address psychosocial challenges, which hinders routine assessment. Clinicians emphasized the importance of assessing psychosocial support and providing pre- and post-operative education to normalize common concerns, especially the emotional aspects of recovery. Given these data, there is a need to develop a patient-centered mechanism to assess psychosocial strengths and vulnerabilities, as well as to serve as a starting point for conversation.

N2  - Background: 30% to 40% of physicians experience burnout at some time and higher rates have been associated with COVID-19. There is a well-established link between burnout and negative outcomes for providers including suicide, depression, anxiety and substance abuse. Ultimately, burnout leads to poor patient outcomes, decreased patient safety, lower productivity and increased medical errors. The Healer's Art Course addresses two main drivers of burnout: loss of meaning and isolation. Both issues have been exponentially impacted by the COVID pandemic. It is important to teach methods to build resilience in healthcare students before burnout occurs. Method(s): We offered trainings to impart capacity to find meaning across the lifespan utilizing the Healer's Art course. The curriculum offered a safe learning environment for personal, in-depth exploration of service, healing relationship, reverence for life and compassionate care. The Healer's Art utilizes principles of adult education, contemplative studies, humanism, cognitive psychology, creative arts and storytelling to present and explore human dimensions of medicine rarely discussed in medical training. The curriculum utilized small group experience, journaling and reflection. This enabled students to uncover and strengthen their altruistic values, sense of calling, and intention to serve thus creating a firm foundation for meeting the demands of medical training and practice. Students evaluated the Healer's Art curriculum. Result(s): 74 medical students participated in the Healer's Art course at NEOMED. Students reported overall quality of the course as a mean of 4.9 (SD 0.3) on a 5-point Likert scale. There was strong agreement (5-point scale) that medical students felt more committed to medicine (mean=4.4, (SD 0.8)) and patient-centered care (mean=4.7, (SD 0.6)). Nearly 50% of participants indicated they would use journaling to reinforce what they have learned in the Healer's Art course. Conclusion(s): Affective domain learning, like the Healer's Art program, is lacking in traditional medical and health care professional training that concentrates on cognitive knowledge and technical skill development. It is important to teach students self-care methods that bolster resiliency to impart life-long skills to prevent burnout.

N2  - Background: Paediatric health systems across high-income countries are facing avoidable adverse outcomes and increasing demands and costs. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of an enhanced usual care model with that of an integrated health-care model that offers local health clinics for general paediatric problems and early intervention and care for children and young people with tracer conditions. Method(s): In this pragmatic two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial, we compared the Children and Young People's Health Partnership (CYPHP) model of care versus enhanced usual care (EUC) among children registered at general practices in south London, UK. The CYPHP trial intervention was delivered between April 1, 2018, and June 30, 2021, and children younger than 16 years during the intervention period and registered at study practices on June 30, 2021, were included in the analysis. A restricted randomisation (1:1) following a computer-generated sequence was done by a masked independent statistician at the level of general practice cluster, stratified by borough (Lambeth or Southwark). Cluster allocation and data collection were masked, with unmasking of trial statisticians before analysis. The CYPHP model comprised all elements of EUC (electronic decision support, a primary care hotline, health checks, self-management support and health promotion, and resilience building and mental health first aid) plus local child health clinics delivered by paediatricians and general practitioners, and a nurse-led early intervention service for children with tracer conditions (asthma, eczema, and constipation). Primary outcomes were non-elective admissions (NELA; admissions coded as an emergency) among the whole trial population up to June 30, 2021, and paediatric quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory [PedsQL]) among participants with tracer conditions at 6 months after recruitment. Secondary outcomes were primary and secondary care use, child mental health, parental wellbeing, standardised symptom scores for asthma, eczema, and constipation, health-care quality, and child absences from school and parent absences from work. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03461848, and is complete. Finding(s): The trial was conducted between April 1, 2018, and Dec 31, 2021. In total, 23 general practice clusters, consisting of 70 practices with 97 970 registered children, were randomised to CYPHP (n=11) or EUC (n=12). We found no effect, at the population level, of CYPHP versus EUC on non-elective admissions during the intervention period (adjusted mean incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.00 [95% CI 0.91 to 1.10], p=0.99). Among children with tracer conditions, we found no difference in paediatric quality of life (PedsQL score) at 6 months (adjusted mean difference -0.033 [95% CI -0.122 to 0.055], p=0.46). As a secondary outcome, among children with tracer conditions and requiring care, NELA rates at 12 months did not differ between the CYPHP and EUC groups (66.1 per 1000 person-years vs 75.3 per 1000 person-years; adjusted mean IRR 0.87 [0.61-1.22], p=0.42). In children requiring care, a statistically significant improvement was observed in eczema symptoms at 6 months from baseline in the CYPHP group versus the EUC group (adjusted mean difference -1.370 [-2.630 to -0.122], p=0.032). Quality of asthma care significantly improved among children in the CYPHP group compared with children in the EUC group. No significant improvement was seen for all other secondary outcomes. Interpretation(s): Although the CYPHP trial found a null effect for the primary outcomes, we found clinically important improvements in some secondary outcomes including care quality. Previous research has shown that large-scale system change requires time to observe a potential positive effect.

N2  - Military personnel are at increased risk of PTSD and gambling disorder (GD), and the two disorders are frequently comorbid. It is likely that gambling may provide an escape- and avoidance-based means of coping with traumatic experiences and associated reminders. Despite the heightened risk, little is known about comorbid PTSD and GD in veterans or the responsiveness of this population to new or existing treatment approaches. Third wave behavioral therapies such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) target a transdiagnostic process - experiential avoidance-believed to be at the root of human suffering. While it is known that ACT shows considerable promise and may improve both PTSD and GD outcomes, research into the potential effectiveness of ACT among veterans is scarce. Here, we systematically review the evidence relating to the use of ACT for military populations with PTSD and/or GD. Next, we outline several areas that warrant further research and clinical treatment development. Finally, we evaluate the potential of ACT-informed treatment of avoidant-based coping in veterans experiencing problems related to PTSD and GD.

N2  - Objective Thoracic aortic disease (TAD) may have substantial impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We described HRQOL in patients with TAD, cardiovascular screening participants and their partners; identified factors associated with HRQOL; and explored lived experiences and feelings of anxiety or depression using a mixed methods design. Methods For this cross-sectional study, all consecutive patients visiting the TAD outpatient clinic (2017-2019) at our centre were asked to complete three questionnaires: the Short Form 36 (SF-36), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Rotterdam Disease Specific Questionnaire (RDSQ). A subsample was invited for in-depth interviews. Results In total, 261 participants were included: 147 patients with TAD (thoracic aortic diameter >=40 mm; 54 females, 36.7%), 114 screening participants (cardiovascular family screening; 71 females, 62.3%) and 66 partners. Compared with the general population, patients with TAD showed markedly lower HRQOL, whereas screening participants' HRQOL was less impaired. Female and younger participants scored significantly lower on the SF-36 and HADS compared with male and older participants. Smaller aortic diameter was associated with better RDSQ score, and previous aortic surgery was associated with higher HADS depression scores. Furthermore, partners scored significantly lower on 2/8 SF-36 subdomains when compared with the general population. From 11 interviewees, determinants of psychological distress included coping strategies, impact on social and professional life, disease-related knowledge, state of aortic diameters and physical symptoms. Conclusions Healthcare professionals must be aware of HRQOL impairments in patients with TAD, particularly in younger females. Moreover, attention for partners is needed. Coping strategies and communication within the family were found to be important factors influencing psychological distress, and might be valuable leads for counselling and HRQOL improvement in this population.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

T1  - Nowcasting waiting lists for elective procedures and surgery in England: a modelling study
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in extensive disruption to the delivery of elective health services. Official figures of NHS waiting lists in England do not account for patients on the hidden waiting list (ie, patients who have symptoms or disease requiring elective procedures who have not been placed on the waiting list due to pandemic-related disruption). The aim of this study was to model the elective procedure backlog in England, including the hidden waiting list. METHOD(S): We used publicly available activity data from NHS Digital to estimate procedure-level backlogs in England for the pandemic period (from Jan 1, 2020, to Dec 31, 2022) compared with expected population need for elective procedures based on pre-pandemic trends, adjusting for population growth and ageing, as well as patient deaths while on the waiting list. The primary outcome was the elective procedure backlog. Elective procedures were defined as including surgery, endoscopy, interventional radiology, and interventional cardiology. The secondary outcome was the procedural hidden waiting list. The elective procedure backlog was reported by specialty and procedure. FINDINGS: The total elective procedure backlog in England on Dec 31, 2022, was modelled to be 4 519 467 procedures. The hidden waiting list was 3 621 423, comprising 80.3% of the total backlog. Half the total backlog (2 228 348, 49.3%) was in people aged 16-59 years. The largest backlogs were in general surgery (1 463 423, 32.4%), orthopaedics (1 001 850, 22.2%), and urology (510 649, 11.3%). Overall, 84.7% (3 827 687 procedures) of the backlog were for day-case procedures. The procedures with the greatest total backlog were sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy (546 930, 12.1%), gastroscopy (376 089, 8.3%), cataract surgery (238 912, 5.3%), and lower limb joint replacement (209 976, 4.6%). INTERPRETATION: NHS waiting lists are an unreliable guide to the true population need for elective procedures. Initiatives are needed to identify and prioritise patients requiring urgent treatment. Most need is for low-complexity high-volume day-case surgery. Sustained, ring-fenced funding is required to invest in scaling up the operative workforce and facilities, and to increase the resilience of surgical services to avoid existing backlogs being compounded by future external pressures. This modelling study is based on an assumption that over the course of the pandemic the incidence of surgical disease did not change.None.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: Women are more vulnerable to post-traumatic stress (PTS) than men, causing several health problems. Nurses should understand and work with women who have experienced trauma and provide interventions to promote their physical, social, and mental health. METHOD(S): This quasi-experimental pilot study used a one-group pre-test/post-test design. Data were collected from 14 women recruited between December 2019 and May 2020 from a self-sufficiency support center in South Korea for sexually-exploited women who had experienced trauma. The program consisted of six one-on-one intervention sessions per week for six weeks. Each session averaged 60~120 minutes. Participants were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and one-month follow-up. Changes in outcome variables over time were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests. RESULT(S): The caring program for health promotion was divided into six sessions: understanding the self, sharing traumatic events and negative emotions, reframing the meaning of traumatic events, identifying thoughts and physical and emotional responses, developing health promotion activities, and maintaining a positive attitude during the process of change. As a result of the caring program, PTS (F = 36.33, p < .001), depression (F = 24.45, p < .001), health-promoting behaviors (F = 7.06, p =.004), and self-esteem (F = 19.74, p < .001) among the participants differed significantly at pre-test, post-test, and follow-up. CONCLUSION(S): This study provides foundational information for the implementation of a theory-driven program by nurses in clinical and community settings to provide comprehensive care for women who have experienced trauma.Copyright © 2023 Korean Society of Nursing Science.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The present study is intended to examine the multiple mediating roles of sleep quality and depression in the relationship between psychological resilience and quality of life in middle-aged and older adults hospitalized with chronic diseases. METHOD(S): From October 2, 2021, to February 27, 2022, a questionnaire survey was conducted using a multistage stratified sampling method among 339 middle-aged and older adults (45 years and over) hospitalized with chronic diseases. These participants were recruited from a hospital in Zhejiang Province, China. The questionnaire included the Aged Cumulative Disease Rating Scale, the Psychological Resilience Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Scale, the Depression Scale, and the Quality-of-Life Scale. A descriptive analysis was performed to characterize the sample. Linear regression was utilized to evaluate the relationship between psychological resilience and quality of life. Amos 24.0 was used to analyze the multiple mediated effects of sleep quality and depression. RESULT(S): Psychological resilience exerted a remarkable direct effect on the quality of life in middle-aged and older adults hospitalized with chronic diseases (beta=0.239, 95% CI=0.125-0.354), which represented 52.98% of the total effect. Through three significantly mediated pathways indirectly affect the quality of life: (1) through the sleep quality pathway (beta=0.115, 95% CI=0.056-0.201), which represented 25.39% of the total effect; (2) through the depression pathway (beta=0. 060, 95% CI=0.023-0.114), which represented 13.24% of the total effect; and (3) through both the sleep quality and depression pathway (beta=0. 038, 95% CI=0.019-0.074), which represented 8.39% of the total effect. The total mediating effect was 47.02%. CONCLUSION(S): Sleep quality and depression mediate the relationship between psychological resilience and quality of life in middle-aged and older adults hospitalized with chronic diseases. Therefore, healthcare professionals and stakeholders should be concerned about the sleep status and mental health of middle-aged and older adults hospitalized with chronic diseases, strengthen their attention to psychological resilience, and provide interventions and treatment measures for hospitalized patients who have sleep problems and depressive tendencies.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented demands and additional stress for nurses in mental health settings. There is no prior evidence on nurses' experience of building and maintaining resilience in the context of work during COVID-19. The aim of this study was to explore the experience and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the resilience of nurses in mental health settings. Data from semi-structured interviews with 20 nurses from an Australian mental health service were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Four main themes were generated: experiencing significant disruptions; making sense of shared chaos; having professional commitment; and growing through the challenges. Nurses' practice and teamwork were disrupted by COVID-19 related changes to care models and infection prevention policies. They successfully adjusted by having awareness of self and others' emotions, using mental and emotional self-regulatory strategies, engaging in self-care, using 'bricolage' to create different ways to provide care, and having mutually supportive relationships. Nurses connected to their sense of purpose and professional commitment to fuel their therapeutic work and sustain care delivery. They experienced personal and professional growth with an increased understanding of their strengths and resilience. In the post-pandemic period, although the challenges presented by the pandemic have lessened, there are ongoing negative impacts on nurses' wellbeing. To maintain and strengthen their wellbeing and practice, the findings indicate the importance of professional development in emotional regulation skills, and strategies to strengthen self-care and build collegial relationships in teams. Resilience education can be implemented to support nurses' resilient practice skills.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - This paper emerged from discussions between the authors about our shared and different perspectives of climate change and its impact on the social, emotional, physical, spiritual and cultural wellbeing of Aboriginal Peoples and mental health services in a rural region, heavily impacted in recent years by bushfires and floods. Here we discuss, from the lead authors personal perspective as a Gamilaraay Woman, the experience of Solastalgia as a critical impact of climate change on wellbeing. Specifically, we discuss the relationship of a connection to country from a Gamilaraay, first person perspective through a series of diary entries from the lead author. Authors are researchers from different cultural backgrounds, connected through a medical research futures fund research project, to promote resilience within Aboriginal communities and the health services sector in the New England, North West region. The lead author has cultural connections to some of the communities we work with and our work is informed by these connections. While this paper was written to express an Aboriginal perspective on climate change and wellbeing, it reflects our shared perspectives of how disasters such as bushfires impact the wellbeing of Aboriginal peoples. We also explore the connection between the impact of localised, recurring natural disasters and the increasing demands on mental health services in regional and rural areas and discuss what this means with Aboriginal and non-Indigenous mental health nurses and researchers working in regional and rural areas where access to mental health services often poses considerable challenges. From our perspective, mental health research and nursing play an important role in walking alongside Aboriginal Peoples as we explore, respond and create resilience to the ever-present influence that climate change is having on our lives, communities, country and workplaces.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The impact of disasters on individual and community health can be extensive. As such, there exists the need to establish recovery measures that provides support psychologically and with additional mental health services and resilience building for affected people and their communities. Nature-led recovery is one such approach that has the ability to positively impact the mental health of people and their communities after a disaster. Nature-led recovery focuses on the social, economic and environmental recovery through activities that connect people and their communities to nature and the natural environment with the aim to foster recovery after a disaster. Nature-led recovery initiatives support the connection of people with nature and the natural environment to support such recovery processes. This review considers both community and government-led responses pertaining to nature-led recovery. The aim of this review is to systematically explore the literature on the impact of nature-led recovery initiatives on individual and community health following a disaster. CONTENT: This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) following a three-step process of planning, conducting and reporting the review. At least three authors reviewed all eligible articles. SUMMARY: There was significant methodological heterogeneity between the sources identified (n=9). A narrative synthesis identified five key themes; A symbol of loss; Nature: the provider; Fostering community connectedness; Spiritual and emotional nourishment; and Regeneration leads to recovery. OUTLOOK: The positive benefits from nature-led recovery initiatives provide an opportunity to promote community connectedness and resilience following a disaster. Further research is needed to explore the implementation and evaluation of these initiatives for community recovery.Copyright © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

N2  - Burnout is common among physicians; it severely alters their health and has a negative impact on functioning of healthcare systems. Hypertension, increased cortisol levels, maladaptive behaviors with negative social consequences, and suboptimal quality of care have been associated with healthcare providers' burnout. As the number of patients with cancers, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders will rise, we need new solutions to maintain physicians' health and, therefore, quality of care. Coping strategies before the COVID-19 pandemic seem ineffective in scaling all the deficits of the global healthcare systems. Examples of new initiatives include new collaborative projects, such as COH-FIT (The Collaborative Outcomes study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times - https://www.coh-fit.com), which aims to collect global data and understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health in order to identify various coping strategies for patients and healthcare workers during infection times, or MEMO (Minimizing Error, Maximizing Outcome), funded by the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Others: i) Rome Foundation GastroPsych undertake efforts dedicated to the science and practice of psychogastroenterology, a burgeoning field with roots in behavioral intervention, cognitive science and experimental psychology focused on fostering the professional growth and collaboration of those engaged in medical practices, or ii) World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO), Train The Trainers (TTT) program including a new topic of the impact of burnout on career longevity in order to foster strategies for staying healthy and increasing career satisfaction. There is a need for continuous development of digital technologies (e.g. training simulators, telemedicine, robots and artificial intelligence). Their implementation into medical practice is inevitable. Now more than ever, there is a need for a new spirit in healthcare. Together with others in the field, we believe this article is a desperate call for maximizing the use of novel technologies supported by collaborative interactions among healthcare providers and medical professionals of diverse medical fields.Copyright © 2023 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

N2  - This study assessed perceptions of German physicians' regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on work-related issues as well as mental and physical health. Almost three quarters of the physicians felt stressed by the increased quantity (69%) and quality (73%) of the work and felt physically (68%) or mentally exhausted (71%). Also about three-quarters of physicians reported the pandemic having a strong impact on family life. A higher proportion feared to infect their family more than being infected themselves (66% vs 50%). Mental health scores were significantly lower in physicians compared to the general population. In female physicians, these findings were even more pronounced. Stressful work conditions and feelings of isolation were the most important predictors for mental health scores (R 2 = 0.37), and also for motivation to work (R 2 = 0.20). Preventive measures to strengthen resilience and optimize work organization are warranted to alleviate the toll of the pandemic on physicians.Copyright © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Resilience is the ability to overcome adversity in response to a potentially traumatic event. It can relieve people's discomfort and build personal capacity when facing a stressful situation such as beta thalassemia major. Resilience is a complex and multidimensional concept and is influenced by protective and risk factors. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to (1) investigate the relationship between protective (social support and hope) and risk (uncertainty and defensive coping) factors with resilience and (2) examine the mediating role of courageous coping between these protective and risk factors in resilience. METHOD(S): This descriptive-analytical study was performed on 312 adolescents and young adults with beta-thalassemia major aged 12-24 years; they were selected using purposeful sampling from two different outpatient thalassemia clinics in the south of Iran. Data were collected in a face-to-face survey using Zimmet Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Herth Hope, Stewart Uncertainty in Illness scale, Jalowiec Coping, and Connor-Davidson resilience Scale from April 2022 to November 2022. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive tests, Pearson correlation, and a structural equation model. RESULT(S): According to the main findings of mediation analysis, courageous coping partially mediated the relationship between social support and resilience [(beta=0.042; 95% BC CI (0.003, 0.131)] and fully mediated the relationship between hope and resilience [(beta=0.166; 95% BC CI (0.031, 0.348)]. In other cases, uncertainty and defensive coping had a direct and indirect effect on resilience, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Based on these results, health professionals and healthcare policymakers should consider this mediator in developing programs to improve resilience. Also, the use of courageous coping could modulate the effect of defensive coping on resilience. Therefore, teaching the use of courageous coping can play an important role in improving resilience.Copyright © 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Introduction: Axi-cel is an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy approved for the treatment of adults with R/R LBCL after >=2 lines of systemic therapy and for R/R LBCL within 12 months of first-line chemoimmunotherapy. In Cohorts 1+2 of the ZUMA-1 Phase 1/2 study of axi-cel in refractory LBCL, 11% and 31% of pts experienced Grade >=3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurologic events (NEs), respectively, and the objective response rate (ORR) was 83% (58% complete response [CR] rate) with >=2 y of follow-up (median, 27.1 mo; Locke, et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019;20:31-42). ZUMA-1 safety management Cohort 6 (N=40), which evaluated whether prophylactic and earlier corticosteroids and/or tocilizumab could improve safety outcomes, demonstrated an improved safety profile (no Grade >=3 CRS; 15% Grade >=3 NEs) versus Cohorts 1+2, and high, durable response rates (95% ORR, 80% CR rate, and 53% ongoing response rate) with >=1 y of follow-up (Oluwole, et al. Blood. 2021;138:2832). Here, 2-y updated outcomes are reported. Method(s): Eligible pts with R/R LBCL underwent leukapheresis (followed by optional bridging therapy) and conditioning chemotherapy, followed by a single axi-cel infusion. Corticosteroid prophylaxis (once-daily oral dexamethasone 10 mg) was given on Days 0 (before axi-cel), 1, and 2. Compared with Cohorts 1+2, corticosteroids and/or tocilizumab were given earlier for CRS and NE management (Oluwole, et al. Br J Haematol. 2021;194:690-700). The primary endpoints were incidence and severity of CRS and NEs. Secondary endpoints included ORR (investigator-assessed), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and CAR T-cell levels in blood. Result(s): As of December 16, 2021, the median follow-up time for the 40 treated pts was 26.9 mo. All pts had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and all reported Grade >=3 events. The most common Grade >=3 TEAEs were neutropenia (80%), leukopenia (40%), and thrombocytopenia (28%). Since the 1-y analysis, no new CRS events were reported (no pts had Grade >=3 CRS to date), the median time to onset of any grade CRS was 5 d, with a median duration of 4 d. The incidence of Grade >=3 NEs increased from 15% to 18% between the 1-y and 2-y analyses. Two new NEs were observed in 2 pts: 1 pt had Grade 2 dementia (onset on Day 685 and ongoing at time of data cutoff; not related to axi-cel), and 1 had axi-cel-related leukoencephalopathy that was ultimately fatal on Day 815. The pt died in hospice care, and an autopsy was not performed. Median time to any grade NE onset was unchanged (6 d), and the median duration was similar to that in the 1-y analysis (19.0 d vs 18.5 d, respectively). To date, 60% of pts had any grade infections, with 28% Grade >=3; 5 pts had COVID-19 infections. Since the 1-y analysis, 6 new infections were reported. Specifically, 1 pt each had Grades 1, 2, and 5 COVID-19 infection, 1 had Grade 3 Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, 1 had a Grade 3 unknown infectious episode with inflammatory syndrome, and 1 had Grade 2 herpes zoster. In total, 8 deaths occurred since the 1-y analysis: 5 due to progressive disease and 3 due to AEs (leukoencephalopathy [n=1] and COVID-19 [n=2]). The ORR was 95% (80% CR), which was unchanged from the 1-y analysis. Median DOR and PFS were since reached (25.9 mo [95% CI, 7.8-not estimable] and 26.8 mo [95% CI, 8.7-not estimable], respectively). Median OS was still not reached. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 2-y DOR, PFS, and OS rates were 53%, 53%, and 62%, respectively. Of 18 pts (45%) in ongoing response at data cutoff, all achieved CR as the best response. By Month 24, 14/20 pts with evaluable samples (70%) had detectable CAR T cells (vs 23/36 pts [64%] in Cohorts 1+2). Similar to the 1-y analysis, median peak CAR T-cell levels were higher in responders at 2 y (65 cells/microL [n=38]) and lower in nonresponders (18 cells/microL [n=2]). Conclusion(s): With longer follow-up, the Cohort 6 toxicity management strategy continued to demonstrate the improved long-term safety profile of axi-cel in pts with R/R LBCL without compromising the response durability or survival outcomes. Further, responses remain high, durable, and similar to those observed in Cohorts 1+2 (Locke, et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019;20:31-42).

N2  - The mental health nursing profession has experienced various challenges since its inception. This discursive review considers these challenges, including how mental health nurses have and can continue to overcome adversity as individuals and as a profession. The discussion examines the influence of the profession's historical involvement in institutionalization and coercive care; the continuing impact of stigma; and the increasing demand for mental health services, amidst chronic staff shortages. Collectively, mental health nurses must harness strong therapeutic relationships, intra- and multi-disciplinary collaboration, personal and professional resilience, education that prepares them for the future, and sector-wide planning and innovation, to respond positively to these challenges. These approaches will support mental health nurses to overcome adversity and achieve positive outcomes for the profession and people with the lived experience of mental illness.

N2  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to explore whether clinical ethical climate mediates the relationship between resilience and moral courage in a population of clinical nurses during COVID-19, and if moral distress faced by nurses is a moderating factor. BACKGROUND: Resilience can help nurses maintain their personal health during COVID-19 when they face great physical and psychological shock and are prone to health problems. Moral courage, as an ethical competency, helps nursing staff in adhering to the principles and values of professional ethics. There is a strong correlation between resilience and moral courage, but the mechanism by which resilience contributes to moral courage is unclear. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study research is designed. Three hundred thirty clinical nurses from six hospitals in Beijing, Sichuan, and Fujian of China were included between August 2021 and March 2022. The survey instruments include the Nurses' Moral Courage Scale (NMCS), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Moral Distress Scale-Revised (MDS-R), and Hospital Ethical Climate Scale (HECS). RESULT(S): Ethical climate mediates 15% of the relationship between resilience and moral courage. The association between resilience and ethical climate, as well as the indirect relationship between resilience and moral courage, was modified by moral distress. DISCUSSION: This study investigated the mechanisms by which resilience affects moral courage in clinical nurses in the context of COVID-19, suggesting that moral courage can be increased by alleviating moral distress and increasing ethical climate. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: This study confirms the mediating effect of moral climate on the relationship between resilience and moral courage, as well as the moderating effect of moral distress. Hospital policymakers should value nurses' psychological resilience and moral courage, develop effective policies to prevent and manage stressors, build social support systems, and create a positive ethical climate.Copyright © 2023 International Council of Nurses.

N2  - Self-Practice/Self-Reflection (SP/SR) is an aspect of therapist training and professional development aimed at enhancing therapy skills, empathy, wellbeing, and resilience in the ultimate furtherance of client outcomes. For many decades, intensive SP/SR has been a required part of therapist training in many countries but relatively little is known about the effect of SP/SR. Studies have found cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) therapists trained under a Beckian CBT paradigm benefitted from more time limited Beckian SP/SR. Mindfulness-based CBT is a more recent third-wave CBT paradigm with psychological process aims similar to those of SP/SR. While training in mindfulness-based CBT often has prominent SP/SR aspects, and mindfulness practice has been shown to benefit health care providers personally and professionally, to date no evaluations have been reported specifically of effects of participation of CBT trainees in stand-alone mindfulness-based SP/SR that meets regulatory requirements for more intensive SP/SR. A study on SP/SR training meeting German requirements is reported here. Post-graduate CBT trainees (N = 95) were assigned to delayed or immediate SP/SR with those in the delayed SP/SR condition crossing-over into SP/SR training after two baseline evaluations on a variety of reflective skill, wellbeing, and resilience measures spaced six to 9 months apart before participating in 120-150 hours of stand-alone mindfulness-based SP/SR followed by a third reevaluation on all study measures. Participants assigned to the immediate SP/SR condition underwent identical SP/SR training with pre/post assessments. Results indicate participation in intensive stand-alone mindfulness-based SP/SR resulted in favorable changes in measures operationalizing all variables. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for training and professional development of CBT therapists.

N2  - Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) and its treatments can have a significant negative impact on the sexual health of survivors and couples, but few studies have specifically examined the impact of PCa-related sexual dysfunction on female partners of survivors. Aim(s): Our objective was to perform a qualitative study to comprehensively characterize female partners' perceptions of the implications of PCa on their sex lives, as well as partners' sexual health concerns and unmet needs. Method(s): We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews about sexual health and unmet needs with female partners of PCa survivors recruited from multiple clinical locations and support groups for PCa caregivers from September 2021 to March 2022. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and independently coded. Participants were recruited until thematic saturation was achieved. Outcome(s): Outcomes of this study were female partner sexual health concerns and unmet needs. Result(s): Among 12 participants, the median age was 65 (range 53 to 81) years, 9 were White, the median time since their partner's PCa diagnosis was 2.25 years (range 11 months to 20 years), and a majority reported that their partner had undergone radical prostatectomy, radiation, and/or hormonal therapy. Major emergent themes pertained to the significant impact of age- and PCa-related sexual dysfunction on female sexual quality of life, the dyadic nature of sexual dysfunction and recovery, the role of the partner in coping with and adjusting to sexual dysfunction, difficulties communicating about sexual dysfunction in an intimate relationship, a lack of physician-led sexual health counseling and support, and the benefit of peer interactions and proactive information seeking in addressing unmet sexual health needs. Clinical Implications: Future efforts should continue to explore the impact of PCa on partner sexual health and address unmet needs through sexual health education and support. Strengths and Limitations: In this study, we identified female partners' sexual health concerns both related to and independent of PCa survivor sexual health. Limitations include exclusion of male partners of survivors and potential responder bias, as partners who agreed to participate may have experienced more sexual health concerns. Conclusion(s): We found that female partners experience PCa-related sexual dysfunction as a couple's disease, grief due to age- and PCa-related sexual losses, and a lack of physician-led sexual health counseling and information. Our results highlight the importance of including partners of PCa survivors in the sexual recovery process and of developing sexual care programs to address partners' unmet sexual health needs.Copyright © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The International Society of Sexual Medicine 2023.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain in a military population is prevalent, is costly, and can limit daily activities and affect soldier readiness. It has been associated with childhood adversity (CA) within the veteran, adult, and pediatric populations. Given the need to maximize soldier resiliency, an examination of the link between CA and chronic pain in an active duty population for a better understanding that informs treatment options is warranted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analytic sample comprised 32 men and 8 women drawn from a retrospective review of 203 intake assessments at an interdisciplinary pain management center. We identified a group (CA) of 20 patients who reported a history of pre-adolescent sexual abuse or living in an "abusive" childhood home and compared it with a control group (no-CA) of 20 patients, matched for age, gender, pain history duration, and pain problem. Validated measures were used to assess pain intensity, interference in functioning and well-being, emotional sequelae of pain as reflected in symptoms of depression and anxiety, and pain-related catastrophic thinking. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and independent samples t-test analyses. RESULT(S): Differences in current, worst, and average pain ratings were non-significant between groups. The CA group reported significantly greater effect of pain on mood (mean: 6.20 versus 4.25, P<.02) and showed a trend toward higher pain interference in functioning (mean: 17.70 versus 15.05, P=.053). The CA patients had significantly more serious depression (mean: 12.65 versus 4.50, P<.001) and anxiety symptoms (mean: 10.60 versus 2.35, P<.001) and significantly higher pain catastrophizing tendency (mean: 30.05 versus 20.50, P<.03). CONCLUSION(S): Overall, the findings suggest that childhood trauma should be considered by providers when treating depression and anxiety in soldiers with chronic pain. Being mindful of trauma-informed care may have implications, perhaps, for cases perceived as treatment resistant.Copyright © The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2023.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: To investigate the impact of special physical training sessions on the formation of cadets' psychological resilience and physical readiness for the stress factors of future professional and combat activities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Material(s) and Method(s): The research involved 96 cadets (men) in the 2nd training year of S. P. Koroliov Zhytomyr Military Institute (Ukraine) aged 18-20 years, who were divided into two groups: the experimental (E, n = 47) and the control (C, n = 49). The cadets of the E group studied according to the authors' program, and the C group cadets - according to the existing program. Cadets' psychological resilience was studied using psycho-diagnostic methods aimed at assessing their volitional qualities. Cadets' physical fitness was assessed by the tests of general and special physical training. RESULT(S): Results: It was found that the level of general physical training of the E and the C group cadets was significantly the same (p > 0.05) at the end of the research but in terms of special physical training and psychological readiness, the E group cadets had all indicators significantly (p < 0.05-0.001) better than those of the C group. CONCLUSION(S): Conclusion(s): It has been proved that the special physical training sessions conducted according to the authors' program were more effective than the existing program in forming cadets' physical readiness and psychological resilience for stress factors of future professional and combat activities.

N2  - Moral distress forms a major threat to the well-being of healthcare professionals, and is argued to negatively impact patient care. It is associated with emotions such as anger, frustration, guilt, and anxiety. In order to effectively deal with moral distress, the concept of moral resilience is introduced as the positive capacity of an individual to sustain or restore their integrity in response to moral adversity. Interventions are needed that foster moral resilience among healthcare professionals. Ethics consultation has been proposed as such an intervention. In this paper, we add to this proposition by discussing Moral Case Deliberation (MCD) as a specific form of clinical ethics support that promotes moral resilience. We argue that MCD in general may contribute to the moral resilience of healthcare professionals as it promotes moral agency. In addition, we focus on three specific MCD reflection methods: the Dilemma Method, the Aristotelian moral inquiry into emotions, and CURA, a method consisting of four main steps: Concentrate, Unrush, Reflect, and Act. In practice, all three methods are used by nurse ethicists or by nurses who received training to facilitate reflection sessions with these methods. We maintain that these methods also have specific elements that promote moral resilience. However, the Dilemma Method fosters dealing well with tragedy, the latter two promote moral resilience by including attention to emotions as part of the reflection process. We will end with discussing the importance of future empirical research on the impact of MCD on moral resilience, and of comparing MCD with other interventions that seek to mitigate moral distress and promote moral resilience.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: To support soldier readiness and mitigate the mental health consequences of deployments, Army regulation mandates soldiers to receive Deployment Cycle Resilience Training (DCRT) throughout their deployment cycle. A recent evaluation revealed several issues with the existing version that threatened the relevancy and usefulness of the training. The present article details the systematic approach taken by the Research Transition Office at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research to revise the DCRT curriculum and presents the revision updates that are now included in DCRT version 3. METHOD(S): Curriculum developers (n=2) with subject matter expertise relevant to the project followed an iterative process that was critical to the efficacy of the revisions. Developers used the existing DCRT modules as the curriculum framework and utilized several materials to inform the revisions to include Army doctrine, data from the quality improvement evaluation conducted by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and the current research related to the deployment cycle, resilience, and behavior change. Internal and external stakeholders (n=31) provided iterative feedback to ensure each of the six modules met DCRT revision objectives. RESULT(S): The revised DCRT curriculum was implemented in August 2021. The resulting revisions included an increase in inclusivity, an emphasis on growth opportunities, an integrative approach to the deployment cycle phases, and greater practical application. Additionally, the curriculum incorporates best practices found to enhance the delivery of resilience-based psychoeducational interventions, specifically within high-risk occupational settings like the military. CONCLUSION(S): The revisions outlined in this article enhance the training quality and potential effectiveness of DCRT, which can positively influence soldier and family readiness and mission success. Furthermore, the deliberate and iterative curriculum revision process can serve as a guide to other curriculum development projects, specifically within the military context. Implementation considerations and potential limitations are provided, and future directions are discussed to include the ongoing evaluation.Copyright Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic growth is a positive psychological change that may aid recovery in individuals experiencing trauma. Owing to the lack of research in the area of parental care for premature infants, we decided to explore the levels and factors influencing post-traumatic growth among parents of premature infants in neonatal intensive care units. We believe that these findings will help reassess existing care practices so that healthcare providers can promptly identify negative emotions and take necessary measures to help develop the potential to enhance post-traumatic growth. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional survey was conducted using convenience sampling between February and September 2022. Data were analysed using independent sample t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Bivariate correlations were analysed using the Pearson's or Spearman's method, and related factors were analysed using multiple linear regression. We followed the SRQR checklist throughout the study period. RESULT(S): A total of 217 patients were effectively treated, with a recovery rate of 98.64%. Univariate analysis showed that the length of hospital stay, presence of only one child, parents' age, marital status, education level, working status, and per capita monthly familial income were influencing factors. Bivariate analysis showed that post-traumatic growth was moderately and positively correlated with perceived social support, rumination, and family resilience. Multiple linear regression showed that purposeful contemplation, family resilience, education, family support, age, and marital status entered into the regression equation and together accounted for 47.4% of the total variation. CONCLUSION(S): It is necessary to pay attention to post-traumatic growth and familial stability in these families, provide aid in building a good support system, and encourage parents to mobilise their family and favourable factors to increase post-traumatic growth levels.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges for brain injury survivors. This vulnerable population was disproportionately affected by this crisis, due to preexisting disparities and a lack of disability-inclusive response. Brain injury associations in Canada play a vital role in providing healthcare services to the over 1.5 million individuals living with brain injury and their families/caregivers. Since the beginning of the pandemic, brain injury associations witnessed the COVID-19 impacts on brain injury survivors and were at the forefront of responding to their emerging needs. Therefore, key representatives of brain injury associations can provide unique insights into the challenges faced by brain injury survivors during the pandemic. This community- partnership research study aimed to: (1) highlight challenges experienced by brain injury survivors during the pandemic from brain injury associations' perspective; (2) understand how brain injury associations adapted their services to address clients' needs; and (3) serve as a basis for preparing initiatives across social and health service providers to promote resilience among brain injury survivors and strengthen brain injury associations' crisis response. Method(s): Focusing on the first year of the pandemic, we analyzed seven online semi-structured focus groups involving 32 brain injury associations' stakeholders from seven Canadian provinces using a qualitative descriptive thematic approach. Result(s): The main challenges faced by brain injury survivors seeking help from brain injury associations were basic needs insecurities (e.g., food, health, income, and housing), negative impacts on mental health (e.g., isolation, fear around COVID- 19), and difficulties complying with public health guidelines. Another key theme was the digital divide: Many individuals with brain injury could not use technology mainly due to lack of knowledge and devices and/or financial resources, limiting their access to community and/or governmental support resources. Brain injury associations quickly adapted to meet those needs by: (1) providing essential services related to food, healthcare, and finance; (2) creating new ways to reach out (e.g., wellness checks, door-step deliveries, porch visits) and shifting toward more one-on-one support services; (3) raising awareness about COVID-19 and helping to follow public health guidelines; and (4) pivoting services/programs to online while providing technological devices and training. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health and safety of thousands of Canadians living with brain injury and highlighted the critical role played by community- based associations in service delivery, particularly regarding alleviating social isolation and accessing government entitlements. Adaptations and innovations in services/programs were identified and included bridging the technology gap and supporting clients to understand and meet public health needs. These findings can facilitate preparedness and collaboration among brain injury associations across Canada to ensure continuity of services after the pandemic and to better protect brain injury survivors in times of public health crises.

N2  - Introduction: Staff burnout within the NHS has reached critical levels due to staff shortages, lack of resources and funding, and the lasting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. 1 Levels of burnout are particularly problematic in intensive care units (ICUs), high acuity environments where staff are frequently exposed to challenging ethical situations, high patient mortality and excessive daily workloads.2 Given that higher levels of burnout are associated with poorer individual wellbeing and lower quality of patient care, improving the wellbeing of staff who work in ICU is crucial. Team-building exercises within healthcare settings have been shown to be an effective buffer against stress, enhancing team cohesion and promoting wellbeing and resilience3. One potential intervention to facilitate this is the Professional Tree of Life (PToL). Originating from narrative therapy, the 'Tree of Life' (ToL) is a strengths-based exercise which supports people to recognise the skills, expertise and resources they already possess to create a more enabling narrative in tackling challenges, through telling the story of their life with the metaphor of a tree. The 'ToL' has since been adapted and applied for use with teams in professional contexts,4,5 but there is limited evidence for its utility and no evidence of its use with staff in ICU settings. Objective(s): The aim of this project is to evaluate the potential utility of the PToL exercise to strengthen team cohesion and improve staff wellbeing within critical care at King's College Hospital (KCH), a tertiary London hospital employing around 14,000 staff. Method(s): A single 90-minute adapted PToL session was developed by the KCH Staff Psychology Service and delivered during team away days, where two teams from different ICUs attend for a variety of training and updates annually. The facilitators began with an introduction to the exercise, followed by each team creating their shared ToL and presenting this to the other team. A mixedmethods approach was used to evaluate the intervention, in which staff were invited to complete anonymous feedback containing both 5-point likert-style and open-ended questions immediately after the session. Demographic information was also collected. Descriptive data was analysed and a thematic analysis was conducted on the qualitative data. Result(s): Across eight months (July 2022 - Feb 2023), fourteen PToL sessions were delivered to 260 participants (78.6% female; 21.4% male) who were predominantly nurses (95.6%). Overall, the intervention was positively received, with 97.3% of participants agreeing that they felt more connected to their colleagues and 98.1% reporting that they felt confident in the team's ability to manage challenges following the session (Figure 1). Analysis of qualitative feedback revealed four overarching themes: (1) Appraisal of PToL session; (2) Strengthening of Team Bond; (3) Space for Reflection; and (4) Enrichment of Team Narrative (Figure 2). Conclusion(s): Overall, the PToL session was found to be an accessible intervention for NHS ICU staff, and easily adaptable from the original ToL model. Experienced as interactive and enjoyable by participants, a shared ToL enhanced team cohesion and connection, and provided a safe space to explore upcoming challenges and shared values.

T1  - EMPATHY AND RESILIENCE IN HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS
A1  - Wilczek-Ruzyczka E. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Empathy and resilience have an indirect effect on raising the level of the quality of care, as empathy is the basis for good interactions between medical workers and patients, and resilience, as a dynamic process, helps caregivers adapt well to difficult working conditions, risks or traumas experienced. The development of empathy and resilience in these medical workers is possible by a training method already employed among medical students in order to both improve the quality of care, but also to more effectively prevent professional burnout. The purpose of the study was to determine the level of empathy and the level of resilience, their possible correlations with each other, as well as the relationship of these variables with socio-demographic variables. The study was carried out in 2021 among 31 doctors and 45 nurses using two main tools - the Emotional-Cognitive Empathy Questionnaire (EEP) devised by Ewa Wilczek-Ruzyczka and the Resilience Measurement Scale(SPP-25) by Nina Oginska-Bulik and Zygfryd Juczynski, as well as a socio-demographic questionnaire. The most valuable results of the study turned out to be the demonstration of statistically significant concordant associations of the empathy level with the resilience level both in general, and their individual factors as statistically significant intercorrelations. In addition, statistically significant differences were shown in the case of cognitive empathy - higher levels of empathy were found among people with longer work experience and women when compared to men. In the case of the level of other components of empathy, as well as resilience, differences so as to be statistically significant could not be confirmed. It is recommended that empathy and resilience training sessions be implemented for health care workers, and that the study be continued with larger research groups, with additional control groups, to refine the programmes of these training sessions.Copyright © 2023, MEDSPORTPRESS Publishing House.

N2  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic represented a shock for healthcare systems. Italy was one of the first country to deal with a huge number of patients to be diagnosed, isolated, and treated with scarce evidence-based guidelines and resources. Several organizational and structural changes were needed to face the pandemic at local level. The article aims at studying the perceived impact of the newly implemented District Operation Centres (DOCs) of Local Health Authority (LHA) Roma 1 in managing active surveillance and home care of COVID-19 patients and their close contacts in cooperation with general practitioners (GPs). METHOD(S): A questionnaire, developed according to Delphi methodology, was validated by 7 experts and administered to a randomized sample of GPs and family paediatricians (FPs). All medical doctors selected received a phone interview between December 2020 and January 2021. The questionnaire investigated general characteristics of the sample, relations with DOC and its usefulness, and potential developments. A descriptive analysis was performed and inferential statistical tests were used to assess differences. RESULT(S): In April 2020 the LHA Roma 1 implemented one DOCs in each local health district. 215 medical doctors were interviewed, reaching the sample target for health districts (80% CL and 10% MOE) and the whole LHA (90% CL and 5% MOE). Several aspects in the management of COVID-19 cases and close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and of the support of DOCs to GPs/FPs were investigated. More than 55% of the GPs and FPs interviewed found the DOCs useful and more than 78% would recommend a service DOC-like to other LHAs. The medical professionals interviewed would use DOCs in the future as support in treating vulnerable patients, utilizing digital health tools, enlisting specialist doctors, establishing networks, and facilitating professional counselling by nurses. CONCLUSION(S): This study is an attempt to evaluate an organizational change happened during COVID-19 pandemic. DOCs were created to support GPs and FPs as a link between primary healthcare and public health. Although several difficulties were disclosed, DOCs' experience can help to overcome the fragmentation of the systems and the duality between primary care and public health and make the system more resilient.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To explore myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) patients' experiences of a health psychological group intervention and its usefulness, non-usefulness or harmfulness for illness management and adjustment. DESIGN: A qualitative longitudinal study using inductive content analysis. METHOD(S): Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 adults. Interviews were conducted before the 16-week intervention, immediately after its completion, and at 3 months after completion. RESULT(S): Participants reported that the intervention was useful and not harmful. The model improved their ability to cope with ME/CFS by providing them with useful information about the illness along with peer support and professional guidance. Participants reported improved illness management and adjustment, which they perceived as an outcome of achieving new ways of thinking, feeling and acting. CONCLUSION(S): Participants viewed the health psychological approach to group intervention as meeting their needs. To achieve better illness management and adjustment, more consideration should be given to supportive interactional processes with peers and healthcare professionals. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The intervention was developed to meet patients' needs of finding ways to manage their illness. The research team consulted eight patients with ME/CFS and three clinical centres working with ME/CFS treatment and rehabilitation at the intervention planning stage. Their comments influenced the planning and content of the intervention as well as ethical issues that should be considered, such as potential harm to participants. All participants were informed about the theoretical foundations of the study and the principles guiding the intervention. Participants were not involved in the data analysis.

N2  - Social support is important for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) recovery and emerging literature indicate that social support could increase engagement in PTSD therapy. However, there is a need to understand how and why family involvement can increase treatment engagement to inform strategies used in clinical practice. This study explores how individuals with PTSD and family members of individuals with PTSD experience therapy and how social interactions help or hinder therapy engagement. We interviewed 18 U.S. military veterans who had been referred for psychotherapy for PTSD in the Veterans Health Administration and 13 family members and used rapid content analysis to identify themes. We found that engaging in therapy was a family-level decision that participants expected to improve family life. Veterans were motivated to seek treatment to protect their relationships with loved ones. Family members generally encouraged veterans to seek treatment. Specifically, family members who viewed PTSD as a treatable illness versus a static aspect of the veteran's personality expressed positive attitudes about the effectiveness of therapy for reducing symptoms. Veterans whose social networks included individuals with prior military or trauma-related experiences reported that their loved ones possessed more understanding of PTSD and described positive subjective norms around therapy. Family members are often embedded in the therapy process because PTSD has a profound impact on the family. Positive subjective norms for therapy are created by family encouragement and may influence veteran perceptions about the value of treatment. Family members should be engaged early in mental health therapy and to the extent desired by the patient and family member. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - Later in life Veterans may report increased thoughts and memories of traumatic military experience in the context of age-related changes, a process called Later-Adulthood Trauma Reengagement (LATR); this process may lead to resilience or distress. We describe the development of a 10-session group intervention with goals of providing psychoeducation about LATR, enhancing stress management and coping skills, and fostering meaning making. We characterize implementation and outcome characteristics for seven group cohorts over 5 years; groups were completed in-person or virtually. Outcomes were measured with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Meaning in Life Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Positive Appraisals of Military experience (PAMES), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Forty-seven Veterans (aged 65-93) began the group, 37 (87%) completed at least six sessions. These 37 Veterans reported an average of eight stressful events in the prior year, mostly major illness, death of a friend, and decline in memory and enjoyable activities, which may have set the stage for LATR. Veterans resonated with the LATR concept on standardized scales and qualitative comments. In pre-post comparisons, participants reported higher levels of PAMES (eta2 = .225), resilience (eta2 = .208), and meaning in life (eta2 = .145), with fewer symptoms of PTSD (eta2 = .199) and depression (eta2 = .124). There were no significant differences in outcomes for those who completed the group in-person or virtually. The LATR protocol may provide a framework for working with older adults reporting emergence or exacerbation of thoughts and memories of earlier trauma in later life, fostering positive adaptation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To understand how firefighters' use of rules (i.e., standard operating procedures [SOPs]) and deliberative decision making (i.e., operational discretion [OD]) interacts with acute stress. BACKGROUND: Current operational guidance for UK firefighters combines the provision of SOPs, for routine incidents, with the use of OD, under prescribed conditions (e.g., when there is a risk to human life). However, our understanding of the use of SOPs and OD is limited. METHOD(S): Incident commanders (ICs; n = 43) responded to simulated emergency incidents, which either licensed the use of OD or required use of a SOP. Video footage of IC behavior was used to code their response as involving a SOP or OD, while levels of acute stress were assessed using a blood-based measure and self-report. RESULT(S): ICs were less likely to use OD selectively in the simulated emergency incident that licensed its use than in the one for which use of an SOP was appropriate; IC command level did not affect this pattern of results; and the incident that licensed OD resulted in more acute stress than the incident that required use of a SOP. CONCLUSION(S): SOPs and OD were not used in the manner prescribed by current operational guidance in simulated emergency incidents. APPLICATION: These results suggest that firefighter training in SOPs and OD should be augmented alongside personal resilience training, given the impact of stress on health and wellbeing, but also to improve the deployment of SOPs and OD under stress.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has constituted an extraordinarily stressful situation for healthcare professionals and has led to psychological distress and an increase in various mental disorders. In the post-pandemic context, it is necessary to provide professionals with strategies and skills to manage this stressful situation and prevent or minimize its negative impact. METHOD(S): Aims: To assess the feasibility and clinical effects of a group psychoeducational program focused on preventing the adverse psychological and emotional effects of the pandemic on primary care workers, and to explore the experience and perceptions of participants with regard to the program from a qualitative perspective. DESIGN: A single-arm, before-and-after study conducted in primary care. SETTING: The 332 primary care centers of the Catalan Institute of Health (Catalonia, Spain) Participants: The target population of the intervention is primary care workers, including clinical profiles (e.g., nurses and doctors), and non-clinical profiles (e.g., administrative staff). The implementation strategy will also involve community psychologists, who will lead the psychoeducational groups, and the health organization promoting the implementation. INTERVENTION: A group psychoeducational program targeting primary care workers to promote emotional well-being and the ability to cope with stressful situations. Community psychologists will deliver it in the primary care centers they are linked to. MEASURES: Mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative and qualitative research. A prospective assessment of the main outcomes (professional quality of life, psychological state, and resilience) will be performed using online questionnaires before and immediately after the intervention, and at 3 and 6 months. A qualitative study will be conducted, comprising focus groups and individual in-depth interviews with the participants in the intervention and the psychologists who provide it. ETHICS: The Research Ethics Committee of the Jordi Gol Primary Care Research Institute (IDIAP) has approved the protocol (22/086-PCV). DISCUSSION: This project proposes an intervention to promote mental health and psychological well-being in primary care workers by learning skills and integrating them into personal and professional life. The expected results will allow us to determine the usefulness and effectiveness of this psychoeducational intervention under the conditions of real clinical practice, provide data to model and perfect it, and promote its dissemination.

N2  - WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Staff working with other people's mental health are in more danger of experiencing high stress at work. These members of staff are more likely to have mental health problems themselves. Previous research has suggested that training these members of staff to deal with their daily stress and become mentally tougher can protect them. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: The findings showed that higher levels of perceived stress and reduced quality of life in mental health workers were related to lower levels of mental toughness. This research provides a detailed understanding of the current issues experienced in a range of different mental health settings, which may contribute to stress and quality of life. The research highlights the importance of protecting staff mental wellbeing, controlling and reducing levels of stress and suggests that one route to doing this is improving mental toughness. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: These findings suggest a need to increase the awareness of and further protect the mental health of staff working in the mentioned settings. Staff working in mental health settings should be provided with information about how to enhance mental toughness and how to reduce stress. This will lead to a better quality of life for mental health staff and in turn improve the quality of care provided. ABSTRACT: Introduction Clinicians working in mental health services are at increased risk of stress at work. Previous work suggests that mental toughness is a protective mechanism for stress in other professions. This has not yet been examined in mental health workers. Aim/Question To examine whether mental toughness predicts perceived stress and quality of life in mental health workers, to develop an understanding of the factors contributing to and techniques used to deal with stress in this population. Method Sixty-two workers completed measures of mental toughness, perceived stress, quality of life and answered questions regarding their personal experience of stress at work. Results Mental toughness was a predictor of stress (F(7,54)=10.58, p<.001) and quality of life (F(6,55)=7.58, p<.001, F(7,54)=7.15, p<.001 and F(7,54)=6.81, p<.001, for compassion satisfaction, burnout and secondary traumatic stress, respectively), with particular roles for the interpersonal confidence and control of life components. Qualitative analysis revealed sources of stress for health workers and a variety of stress management techniques to cope with workplace stress. The findings suggested that mental toughness develops in some but not all health workers due to the demands of their role. Discussion The findings provide an insight into stress, quality of life and protective factors for stress in mental health workers and suggest that future research should consider mental toughness training in mental health workers. Implications for Practice There is a need to increase the awareness of factors contributing to stress in mental health workers, such as a lack of resources and staff, and to promote organizational change to improve their professional quality of life. Future research should also explore the potential of mental toughness training in this population.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: This article explores the impact of mental health issues on paramedics in Australia, particularly Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, caused by their exposure to high levels of stress. The prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is higher among paramedics than any other occupation, and this could be a cause for concern, especially for undergraduate student paramedics. The article examines the need to build resilience among student paramedics to help them handle the trauma they may experience during clinical placement. METHOD(S): This study conducted a two-step process to review literature and university handbooks to determine the level of education provided to paramedic students on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and resilience during clinical placement, due to the lack of research in this area. The first step involved a search for relevant articles, while the second step involved a search of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency website to identify paramedicine programs and a manual evaluation of each undergraduate pre-registration paramedicine curriculum in Australia. RESULT(S): This study conducted a systematic search of national and international literature and Australian undergraduate pre-registration paramedicine programs to identify any studies pertaining to the education of paramedic students in resilience and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The search found that only 15 (5.95 %) of the 252 reviewed subjects had reference to mental health, resilience or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, with only 4 (1.59 %) of them discussing these topics in preparation for clinical practice. The study highlights the lack of emphasis on student paramedic self-care as an essential underpinning for clinical placement preparation in the curriculum. CONCLUSION(S): This literature review concludes that appropriate training and support, teaching resilience, and promoting self-care are crucial in preparing paramedic students for the emotional and psychological demands of their work. Equipping students with these tools and resources can improve their mental health and well-being and enhance their ability to provide high-quality care to patients. Promoting self-care as a core value in the profession is essential in creating a culture that supports paramedics in maintaining their own mental health and well-being.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - The aim of this study was to explore how nurses can alleviate protective buffering between adult patients with cancer and their adult family caregivers (PROSPERO No. CRD42020207072). An integrative review was conducted. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for primary research articles published between January 2010 and April 2022. Only research conducted in oncology, hematology, or multiple settings and investigating communication between adult patients with cancer and their adult family caregivers and/or the communication between patients, family caregivers, and nurses was included. The constant comparison method outlined the approach to the analysis and synthesis of the included studies. Titles and abstracts of 7,073 references were screened; 22 articles (19 qualitative and three quantitative studies) were included in the review. Three themes emerged during data analysis: (a) family coping, (b) an isolating journey, and (c) the nurse's role. A study limitation was that "protective buffering" is not a common term in the nursing literature. There is a need for further research on protective buffering in families with cancer, particularly on psychosocial interventions that focus on the whole family across various cancer types.

N2  - Introduction: Fear and anxiety are common psychological symptoms associated with living with lung cancer, but research in this area is lacking. With improved medical outcomes and longer survival, it is paramount to identify and understand the negative impacts of fear and anxiety, the types of support lung cancer patients need, and the extent to which these needs are being met. In this study, a patient-led research group, the Canadian Lung Cancer Advocacy - Breathe Hope group, surveyed Canadian lung cancer patients and analyzed their responses. Method(s): An online questionnaire was designed (adapted from Luigjes-Huizer et al., 2022) using the SurveyMonkey platform and was distributed online via e-mail, newsletters, and social media platforms to Canadian lung cancer patients between January 24 to February 6, 2023. All questions were multiple-choice, and data was analyzed using descriptive-analytic tools. Result(s): Out of 121 respondents, 119 reported experiencing worry, fear and anxiety. Symptoms varied, including feeling nervous/restless (55%) and sleeping poorly (51%). Participants reported the most intense fear and anxiety experiences were around the initial diagnosis (77%) and preceding medical appointments (e.g., blood work, CT scans and MRI scans; 55%). The common triggers of worry, fear and anxiety are medical examinations (78%), having any physical complaints (58%) and thinking about the future (56%). While over 82% of respondents reported having access to mental health care services, 67% of patients reported that they had never been referred to mental health services by their oncology team. The coping strategies that lung cancer patients most commonly used included 1) talking to someone about their worry, fear and anxiety (71%), 2) distracting themselves with enjoyable activities (61%), and 3) gaining practical tips on dealing with the anxiety and fear symptoms (50%). The most influential systems of support identified were patient support groups (65%) and psychologists/therapists within the hospital/cancer care centre (47%). Approximately 87% of respondents reported experiencing "scanxiety" (a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease about an imminent CT scan for cancer). Among them, 30% of patients "spend much of their time worrying about scanxiety." Meanwhile, the proportion of patients actually speaking to medical care teams and mental health teams about scanxiety was only 13% and 15%. The most common ways to cope with scanxiety were 1) speaking with family, friends and co-workers (53%), 2) distracting oneself by doing enjoyable activities and praying (53%), and 3) being a part of patient support groups (online, virtual; 42%). Conclusion(s): Fear and anxiety are prominent psychological experiences that are a part of living with lung cancer. Yet the majority of patients are not receiving information or referrals for mental health support from their oncology care teams. Although there is a sample bias in this studies of patients who receive peer support, it's still valid that many patients rely on patient support groups, friends and family for support. This study highlights serious gaps in the mental health support systems available to lung cancer patients. Developing awareness and effective programs to address these needs is an important direction for future research and clinical practice.

N2  - Purpose of Review: This review aims to expand understanding of the effect of SDOH on youth and family mental health outcomes. The review highlights significant findings from recent literature across SDOH categories (Economic Stability, Education Access/Quality, Health Care Access/Quality, Neighborhood/Built Environment, and Social/Community Context). This review also aims to demonstrate how the COVID-19 pandemic influences these effects. Recent Findings: Economic instability (i.e., poverty, food insecurity) is associated with poorer MH outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic limited access to mental health resources, including reduced opportunities for school-based mental health services and insurance barriers. Systemic factors, such as community violence and racism, exacerbate MH disparities. Summary: Policy decisions, especially those addressing poverty, can help youth and family exposures to SDOH, ACEs, and TS, which can help improve youth mental health outcomes at the population level. Findings on negative consequences of SDOH factors should be balanced with reporting findings of resiliency and other associated protective factors.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Introduction: Failure to provide effortful performance on cognitive testing is not uncommon for participants in clinical trials and can significantly impact sensitivity to treatment effect. Whether poor effort on cognitive testing might relate to other behaviors of interest is unknown. In the current investigation, we examined whether effort on baseline cognitive testing in a randomized controlled trial to enhance resiliency in US Army Officers predicted subsequent success in Ranger school. Method(s): Baseline data on six cognitive tests were obtained from 237 US Army Officers entering a military training program prior to attempting Ranger School. Participation was voluntary and the Army was not informed of test scores. "Poor effort" was defined by chance-level accuracy or extreme outlier scores. Logistic regression examined likelihood of Ranger success according to the number of tests with poor effort. Result(s): Overall, 170 (72%) participants provided good effort on all tests. For these participants, 47% were successful in Ranger, versus 32% with poor effort on one test and 14% with poor effort on two tests. Logistic regression analysis found poor effort on baseline testing predicted reduced likelihood of Ranger success, beta =-.486, p =.005. Discussion(s): A substantial number of participants exhibited poor effort on testing, and poor effort was predictive of failure in Ranger school. Findings highlight the importance of assessing effort in clinical trials involving cognitive outcomes and suggest application of cognitive effort testing in trials where other motivated behavior is targeted.

N2  - Using latent profile analyses, the current work investigated levels of adverse childhood experiences, symptoms of anxiety and depression and 3 dimensions of relational promotive factors) to identify resilience profiles in a large general population sample (N = 161,622, mean age = 53.02; SD = 17.80; 56.1% females). We then used the same method to identify the resilience profiles of military veterans (N = 386, mean age = 43.47; SD = 10.08; 9.8% females), all of whom had served in Afghanistan. A four-profile-solution was the best fitting for the general population (High resilient 30%, Moderate resilient 13%, Low resilient 53%, Work/social-based resilience 4%), while a three-profile-solution had the best fit in the veteran cohort (Family-based resilience 28%, Work/social-based resilience 62%, Hardy loners 10%). To ground the identified profiles in occupational function, we also checked how they predicted reports of sleep difficulties, job demand and job control. Despite both samples inhabiting a geographic region known for high socioeconomic similarity among residents, we found marked differences in profile-solutions between the military veterans and the general population. Our findings suggests that resilience profiles are highly influenced by cohort characteristics and the specific resources needed to manage a given stressor load. Accordingly, the generalisability of specific protective factors may be low across distinct cohorts, and reliable findings need to be obtained in specific populations as defined by stressor context, sample characteristics, and relevant outcomes.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Introduction: An increased nurse's workload might break the balance between work and life, reducing nurses' quality of life. This condition can lead to physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion. Nurses with low resilience may develop psychological issues or mental illness. This study aims to determine the relationship between workload, resilience, and quality of life of nurses. Method(s): A cross-sectional study with proportionate stratified random sampling was implemented in nurses working at type B hospitals in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. A total of 265 nurses were enrolled in this study during September-October 2022. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), The Russel & Russel questionnaire, and the WHOQOL-Brief quality of life were used on this research instrument. The Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) was used to investigate the effect of mediating resilience on the link between workload and quality of life in nurses. Result(s): The study's findings indicate that workload (X) and resilience (M) affect quality of life (Y) (53.1%). Nurses' workload affects the quality of life via resilience (Path coefficient = -0.049, p = 0.041). It can be interpreted that nurses' workload has a negative and substantial link with the quality of life due to resilience. Conclusion(s): This study concludes that resilience mediates the relationship between nurses' workload and quality of life.Copyright © 2023 International Journal of Occupational Safety and Health.

N2  - Genome sequencing (GS) has the potential to reduce the "diagnostic odyssey" that many parents of children with rare undiagnosed conditions experience. While much research has considered the impact of receiving a diagnostic result, research has rarely focused solely on the impact of receiving a "no primary finding" (NPF) result. This study aimed to investigate the experience of parents of children with rare and undiagnosed conditions following an NPF result from GS. Nine parents whose child had an NPF result from GS were recruited through the social media platform of the charity SWAN (Syndromes Without A Name) UK. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using grounded theory. Analysis led to the emergence of two main themes. The first theme "Striving to Solve the Unsolved Puzzle" concerned the experience of striving to end the "diagnostic odyssey." The second theme "Navigating Hope, Lost then Found" plots the trajectory of hope raised by the promise of a new technology, dashed by the NPF, and the eventual return of small and distant hope for the future. Taken together, these themes allowed for a proposed theory: "The Disequilibrium of Hope," which highlights the dynamic and modifiable experience of hope participants experience in their GS journey. These results suggest GS can be an emotional rollercoaster for parents. While hope plays an important role in coping with the day-to-day life of living with a rare disease, careful management of expectations from GS is important during pre-test counseling, and continued follow-up and support are needed beyond result disclosure. An understanding of the disappointment and distress caused by an NPF result is valuable for healthcare professionals in this field to ensure counseling can be tailored. Further research should consider how to support parents after an NPF result.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

T1  - UNDERSTANDING THE NUANCES: NAVIGATING THE MENTAL HEALTH LANDSCAPE OF INDIAN ADOLESCENTS IN THE COVID-19 ERA
A1  - Kumar P.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Background: The mental health of Indian teenagers was already a concern pre-pandemic, with notable issues and high youth suicide rates, as per the National Mental Health Survey of 2016. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, introducing online learning and reduced social interactions, have potentially exacerbated these concerns. Given this context, insights from psychiatrists become crucial to comprehending the evolving mental health landscape among Indian adolescents during these challenging times. Aim(s): This research investigates the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on teenage students at Ahmedabad Secondary School. By analyzing students' self-perceptions and coping mechanisms alongside insights from Indian psychiatrists, the study aims to offer a holistic view of adolescent mental well-being during this crisis. The ultimate objective is to inform potential interventions and support strategies. Material(s) and Method(s): A dual approach was used. Firstly, questionnaires capturing self-perceptions, emotions, coping mechanisms, and the pandemic's impact were administered to students. Secondly, psychiatrists were surveyed to discern their observations on the mental health trends among teenage students. Result(s): The student data revealed mixed levels of satisfaction in personal (53.5%) and school life (46.5%), with 62% identifying academic pressures as primary anxiety sources. The pandemic further exacerbated mental well-being challenges for 41% of students. On the clinician front, there was recognition of a significant number of moderate to severe mental health issues in adolescents. Cognitive-behavioral therapy was highlighted as the most adopted therapeutic approach. Conclusion(s): The multifaceted challenges faced by Indian adolescents, compounded by the pandemic's effects, are evident. The importance of integrating school-centric interventions with therapeutic modalities, as indicated by the dominance of cognitive-behavioral therapy, cannot be overemphasized. Collaborative efforts among educational institutions, healthcare providers, and policymakers are essential to foster a nurturing environment addressing the mental health concerns of India's youth.Copyright © 2023, Codon Publications.

N2  - Background: Accommodating and addressing the beliefs and attitudes of Muslim patients, means designing culturally competent mental health services. Practicing Muslims around the world often use the Qur'an when seeking guidance for health. Aim(s): The aim of this study was to identify interventions using the Qur'an as a promoting factor for mental health. Method(s): The paucity of academic literature in the area meant a systematic scoping review of the evidence was appropriate. Conducting the search for peer-reviewed evidence used six databases, searching for grey literature used Google Scholar, for evidence published up to 29th December 2022. Analysis used the Patterns, Advances, Gaps, Evidence for practice and Research recommendations (PAGER) framework for scoping reviews to report the findings clearly and accessibly. Result(s): Out of 1590 articles from databases and 35 from other sources (n = 1625), 79 full-text articles meeting the inclusion criteria were retrieved. Further assessment for eligibility, excluded 35 articles; leaving 44 studies in the final analysis. Interventions identified Salah and supplicant praying, recitation, reading, memorizing and listening to the Qur'an to reduce anxiety, depression and stress and increase quality of life and coping. There was a paucity of evidence from Western countries utilising the Qur'an to support mental health and wellbeing, suggesting a lack of cultural accommodation. Interventions tended to be mostly biomedical and excluded exploration of psychosocial factors such as the effect of social support. Conclusion(s): Future research could utilise the Qur'an for Muslim patients, integrating it into routine health care interventions and delivery platforms and more closely relating to Islamic lifestyles. This aims to promote mental health and wellbeing, working towards the WHO 2013-2030 MHAP building mental health and psychosocial support capacity and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3, good health and wellbeing, by 2030.Copyright © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - PURPOSE: High rates of firearm injury among urban Black men in the US can lead to long physical and psychological recovery times, worsened by limited access to mental health services. Spirituality can propel positive thoughts, actions, perceptions and behaviors about self and others yet how it is used among Black men recovering from firearm injury is underexplored. This study examined the role of spirituality in the recovery of Black male survivors of firearm injury. METHOD(S): Ten injured urban Black men in Philadelphia were interviewed using descriptive phenomenology. A subset of participants from the Emotional Responses and Recovery from Injury in Urban Black Men study who agreed to be recontacted for future studies were enrolled. Informed consent was obtained, semi-structured interviews were conducted via phone and were audiotaped, transcribed, and de-identified. Thematic content analysis was used to understand perceptions of spirituality and to identify spiritual coping behavior themes. RESULT(S): Findings suggest that injured urban Black men engaged in theistic and non-theistic spiritual activities that resulted in positive character development, reduced risk of re-injury, hope, improved mental health and social bonds. CONCLUSION(S): Spirituality may serve as a protective factor against firearm re-injury or retaliation by promoting desired behaviors and mental health among injured urban Black men. Combining culturally sensitive spiritual resources and psychotherapy may lead to effective trauma-informed care in addressing spiritual and existential challenges of injured urban Black men who may find spirituality important.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Health care providers may risk retraumatizing patients and intensifying patient distress unless they practice trauma-informed care. As the first line of defense in assisting trauma survivors' physical and emotional recovery, health care providers must use a strengths-based framework that promotes resilience and expands on the trauma survivor's existing resources. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to compare the effect of trauma-informed care training on the attitudes of emergency department personnel, staff advocates, and nursing students toward trauma-informed care. METHOD(S): This study used a pretest-posttest design. Assessment of attitudes toward trauma-informed care was done before and after trauma-informed care training. Data collection occurred from February 2021 through August 2021. Participants included three cohorts of emergency department staff, advocates for trauma survivors, and nursing students. Attitudes toward trauma-informed care were measured using the Attitudes Related to Trauma-Informed Care (ARTIC) Scale. RESULT(S): A total of 433 participants were studied, including 88 emergency department staff, 123 staff advocates, and 222 nursing students. All three cohorts significantly increased ARTIC Scale scores posttraining (p < .001). At preintervention, all three cohorts significantly differed from each other on ARTIC Scale scores (p < .01). In contrast, postintervention, ARTIC Scale scores did not significantly differ between nursing students and advocates (p = .99). Nursing students showed a significant increase in scores from pre- to postintervention compared with either advocates or emergency department staff. CONCLUSION(S): The results strongly suggest that health care providers can improve attitudes toward trauma-informed care after completing training on the principles and application of trauma-informed care.Copyright © 2023 Society of Trauma Nurses.

N2  - This study explores the effects of an online mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention on postpandemic era nurses' subjective well-being, job burnout, and psychological adaptation. Previous studies on the psychological adaptability of nurses mainly focused on investigation rather than intervention. Ninety nurses were randomly classified into an intervention or control group. The intervention group received weekly online mindfulness-based stress reduction training for 8 weeks. The Subjective Well-being, Job Burnout, and Psychological Use scales were administered pre- and postintervention. Postintervention, nurses' positive emotions and life satisfaction significantly improved. Nurses' psychological adaptation was significantly higher postintervention than preintervention. The total scores for negative emotion, low personal accomplishment, and job burnout were significantly lower postintervention than preintervention. The scores for positive emotion and life satisfaction in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group, and the scores for low personal accomplishment in the intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Online mindfulness-based stress reduction interventions can improve nurses' subjective well-being, reduce job burnout, and improve their level of psychological adaptability. Moreover, it could promote nurses' ability to communicate mindfully with patients and their families. This intervention could help promote the development of mindfulness in the nursing field.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nurses and nursing students have been at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19, often working in conditions that produce stress injuries and burnout. Early recognition and mitigation of stress and emotional trauma help prevent burnout. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of an online 8-hour stress awareness course and associated 1-hour support group in reducing stress and burnout among nursing students. METHOD(S): We conducted a program evaluation for an online stress awareness pilot course offered to nursing students. The course, and associated support groups led by trained psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner students, included a common language for talking about stress, screening tools for recognizing stress injuries, and strategies for improving self-care. Students completed pre- and post-course surveys. Outcome measures included changes on course learning objectives, level of burnout, health-related locus of control, and experiences of stress and coping. RESULT(S): Nursing students (n = 360) enrolled in the course, and 224 (62%) completed pre- and post-course surveys. Sixty percent rated the course excellent or very good. Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales and Impact of Event Scale Revised scores were within established normal ranges. There was a significant increase in all nine course learning objectives (p < .001) and decreased signs of stress (p < .001). Students' level of burnout decreased by odds ratio = 0.58 (95% CI: [0.4, 0.9], p < .006). CONCLUSION(S): Nursing leaders can use psychoeducational strategies to mitigate the impact of stress, build confidence, and support nursing students entering the workforce during these unprecedented times.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the degree of resilience and self-perceived physical and mental health in nurses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: Work-related stress among nurses is recognized as an antecedent of burnout, which in turn impacts resiliency and well-being. The work of nursing has long been noted as stressful. Although nurse resilience and perceived well-being have been shown to decrease during a period of usual stress (constant and chronic), the impact and significance of prolonged stress on nurse resilience and well-being illuminates throughout the literature. METHOD(S): Replicating a cross-sectional prepandemic study, nurses were resurveyed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. In both studies, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and PROMIS Global Health was used to measure respondent's: 1) resilience level; 2) physical health status; and 3) mental health status, respectively. Independent 2-sample t tests were performed to compare the pre-and-post score differences in the 3 outcomes. To identify characteristics that were associated with the pre-and-post differences, comparison analyses were also performed within each level of the respondents' characteristic variables. RESULT(S): A higher proportion of postsurvey respondents reported working more than 8 hours of overtime per week, had thoughts of quitting their current job, and thought their workload was too much compared with the presurvey respondents. Generally, the postgroup resilience scores and self-perceived physical and mental scores were statistically significantly lower compared with the pregroup scores, but those differences were only observed in certain subgroups defined by respondents' characteristics. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Self-perceived physical and mental health are significantly associated with the degree of resilience and worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in younger and older nurse cohorts. Engaged nurse leaders are key to implement interventions that build resilience and perceived well-being during periods of usual and prolonged stress.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Self-harm rates and clinical presentations differ by ethnicity. South Asian women are at risk of self-harm. Previous research suggested investigating individuals' experiences with self-harm with qualitative studies in developing self-harm prevention strategies. This research aims to explore self-harm experiences among South Asians in the United Kingdom. DESIGN: Qualitative study. METHOD(S): Participants were recruited via third-sector organizations and online platforms. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 South Asian individuals with a history of self-harm living in the United Kingdom. The data were analysed based on a reflective thematic analysis approach. RESULT(S): Results revealed four main themes: (1) reasons for self-harm; (2) recovery journey; (3) culture and mental health; and (4) the transition to suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Reasons for self-harm included negative life circumstances, social life difficulties, challenges faced during COVID-19 and mental health problems. Participants described their recovery journey by acknowledging the role of professional help, self-care, psychoeducation and personal growth, improving social relationships, and faith and spirituality. Cultural factors included generational differences and stigma. Culturally adapted psychological interventions were perceived as promising. The reported transition from self-harm to suicidal behaviours was linked to experiencing major stressful life events and the use of severe methods of self-harm. CONCLUSION(S): The findings suggest that socio-cultural factors impact mental health and recovery processes among South Asians. Mental health services should consider improving culturally sensitive clinical practices in responding to self-harm among South Asian communities.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Serious COVID-19 nosocomial infection has demonstrated a need to design our health services in a different manner. Triggered by the current crisis and the interest in rapid deployable hospital, this article discusses how hospital building layouts can be improved to streamline the patient pathways and thus to reduce the risk of hospital-related infections. Another objective of this work is to explore the possibility to develop flexible and scalable hospital building layouts through modular construction. This enables hospitals to better cope with different future demands and thereby enhance the resilience of the healthcare facilities. BACKGROUND: During the first wave of COVID-19, approximate one-seventh to one-fifth COVID-19 patients and majority of infected healthcare workers acquired the disease in NHS hospitals. Similar issues emerged during the Crimean War (1853-1856) when more soldiers died from infectious diseases rather than of battlefield casualties in Scutari Hospital. This led to an important collaborative work between Florence Nightingale, who looked into this problem statistically, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who designed the rapid deployment Renkioi Hospital which yielded a death rate 90% lower than that in Scutari Hospital. While contemporary medical research and practice have moved beyond Nightingale's concept of contagion, challenges of optimizing hospital building layouts to support healing and effectively combat nosocomial infections still pose elusive problems that require further investigation. METHOD(S): Through case study investigations, this article evaluates the risk of nosocomial infections of airborne transmissions under different building layouts, and this provides essential data for infection control in the new-build or refurbished healthcare projects. RESULT(S): Improved hospital layout can be achieved through reconfiguration of rooms and concourse. Design interventions through evidence-based infection risk analysis can reduce congestion and provide extra separation and compartmentalization which will contribute the reduced nosocomial infection rate. CONCLUSION(S): A resilient hospital shall be able to cope with unexpected circumstances and be flexible to change when new challenges arise, without compromising the safety and well-being of frontline medical staff and other patients. Such an organizational resilience depends on not only flexible clinical protocols but also flexible hospital building layouts. The latter allows hospitals to get better prepared for rapidly changing patient expectations, medical advances, and extreme weather events. The reconfigurability of an existing healthcare facility can be further enhanced through modular construction, standardization of building components, and additional space considered.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Compassion fatigue, stress, and burnout have an adverse impact on nurse managers. PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of a compassion fatigue resiliency program on nurse managers and to obtain their views of the program. METHOD(S): This mixed-methods study was conducted with 16 nurse managers. The compassion fatigue resiliency program was implemented; compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, burnout, perceived stress, and resilience were assessed before and after implementation of the program. RESULT(S): The mean compassion fatigue and perceived stress scores of nurses decreased significantly after the intervention. Four themes were identified from qualitative analysis, including awareness, coping with stress, effective communication skills in team management, and recommendations. CONCLUSION(S): The current study shows the training program reduced nurse managers' compassion fatigue and stress and enabled nurse managers to improve their coping skills and awareness.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
