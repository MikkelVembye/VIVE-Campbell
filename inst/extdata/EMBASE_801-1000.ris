N2  - Much attention has been paid to the environmental toxicity and ecological risk caused by cyclic tetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) pollution in military activity sites. In this study, the response mechanism of alfalfa plants to HMX was analyzed from the aspects of the photosynthetic system, micromorphology, antioxidant enzyme system, mineral metabolism, and secondary metabolism, in order to improve the efficiency of plant restoration. Exposure to 5 mg.L-1 HMX resulted in a significant increase in leaf N content and a significant increase and drift of the Fourier transform infrared protein peak area. Transmission electron microscopy images revealed damage to the root system subcellular morphology, but the plant leaves effectively resisted HMX pressure, and the photosynthetic parameters essentially maintained steady-state levels. The root proline content decreased significantly by 23.1-47.2 %, and the root reactive oxygen species content increased significantly by 1.66-1.80 fold. The roots regulate the transport/absorption of many elements that impart stress resistance, and Cu, Mn, and Na uptake is significantly associated with secondary metabolism. The metabolism of roots was upregulated in general by HMX exposure, with the main differences appearing in the content of lipids and lipid-like molecules, further confirming damage to the root biofilm structure. HMX causes an imbalance in the energy supply from oxidative phosphorylation in roots and generates important biomarkers in the form of pyrophosphate and dihydrogen phosphate. Interestingly, HMX had no significant effect on basic metabolic networks (i.e., glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle), confirming that alfalfa has good stress resistance. Alfalfa plants apparently regulate multiple network systems to resist/overcome HMX toxicity. These findings provide a scientific basis for improving plant stress tolerance and understanding the HMX toxicity mechanism.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Objectives Stress among free clinic patients is an important issue to address in health care. Evaluating the differences between perceived stress and physiological stress will help healthcare professionals to better understand the stress and coping management skills that will improve health outcomes for underserved populations. The aim of this study was to accelerate research to better understand the biological and psychological aspect of stress in health disparities. Methods This was a cross-sectional study using a convenience sample of free clinic patients aged 18 years and older who spoke English and/or Spanish. Multiple modals of data were collected from 178 participants during summer 2019, including a self-administered paper survey and a biomedical saliva sample. Descriptive statistics were used to present the characteristics of the participants, and a correlation heatmap was used to show a graphical representation of the main variables. Two models of multivariable regression were performed to understand factors associated with cortisol and perceived stress. Results Higher levels of perceived stress were not significantly more prevalent than higher levels of salivary cortisol among free clinic patients; however, higher levels of social networking were significantly associated with lower levels of perceived stress. Our analysis revealed that having more friends in a social network was slightly more associated with lower levels of perceived stress than having more family members. Conclusions The result of this study provides awareness to healthcare promoters and educators concerning the health of uninsured patients. More specifically, this study provides a foundation to understand the salivary cortisol levels and the relation to perceived stress among this population. Further studies are needed to measure salivary cortisol repeatedly during a period of time among a larger population to better understand the reasons behind normal cortisol level manifesting along with chronic stress.Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Healthcare workers are at increased risk for developing posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) during the pandemic. Furthermore, the pandemic has been shown to reduce positive mental health and satisfaction with life in adults. It is important to explore factors that not only decrease poor mental health, but enhance positive well-being. Although gratitude is associated with stress-resilience and positive well-being, this has not been examined in longitudinal studies or among healthcare workers. The objective of this study was to test whether gratitude (Gratitude Questionnaire-6) was related to trajectories of pandemic-related PTSS (Impact of Events Scale - anchored to the pandemic) and positive mental health (Positive Mental Health Scale). We recruited U.S. healthcare workers who were assessed longitudinally during the early phase of the pandemic in April/May 2020 (N =181), one month later (N = 135), and six months later (N = 111). We carried out a latent growth mixture model to identify trajectories of PTSS and positive mental health. Successive classes were added while assessing fit indices and identified a three-class solution for PTSS: resilient (low PTSS that stayed low), recovery (initially moderate PTSS that decreased over time), and chronic PTSS (high PTSS that stayed high). For positive mental health, we identified a three-class solution: stable high positive mental health, stable moderate positive mental health, and stable low positive mental health. We included demographics and job-related covariates in the model (i.e., age, gender, ethnoracial group, and direct provision of healthcare services to patients) to test whether gratitude was an important predictor of mental health trajectory over and above these factors. For pandemic-related PTSS, higher gratitude was associated with being in the resilient (low stable) vs chronic (high stable) trajectory class (OR = .59, p < .01). For positive mental health, higher gratitude was associated with being in the high-stable vs moderate-stable (OR = .74, p < .001) or low-stable trajectory classes (OR = .54, p < .001). In sum, gratitude was associated with resilience against PTSS and enhanced positive well-being among healthcare workers. Increasing gratitude may be a promising pathway for improving the resilience of healthcare workers working in high-stress settings, such as early phases of the pandemic.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Evidence has shown that large-scale pandemics can have prolonged psychological impacts on health care professionals. The current study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of burnout after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic peak and to explore the prolonged impact of COVID-19 on burnout among Chinese anesthesiologists. METHOD(S): From August 2021 to October 2021, a nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted. Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Service Survey. Basic demographic information, exposure to COVID-19, and perceived institutional support were documented. Validated tools measuring mental health status, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and resilience, were also used to provide additional information on psychological distress. RESULT(S): Of the 8850 anesthesiologists from the 218 institutions who were invited to participate, 6331 (74.93%) completed the surveys and were included in the analysis. A total of 52.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51.5-53.9) met the criteria for burnout. Depression, anxiety, and PTSD were positively associated with burnout. After pooled multivariate analysis adjusting for potential confounding factors, among the COVID-19 exposure parameters, redeployment outside normal professional boundaries remained associated with an increased risk of burnout (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.92; P =.039). Higher perceived institutional support and resilience could act as protective factors against burnout. CONCLUSION(S): The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the psychological well-being of anesthesiologists still exists more than 1 year after the outbreak. Building better institutional support and cultivating stronger resilience may be helpful future intervention measures.Copyright © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

N2  - Afghan children have suffered for decades because of chronic socioeconomic health crises. The current state of Afghanistan has deprived the basic human needs of children. The lack of freedom leaves their voices unheard, causing detrimental effects on their mental health. Mental illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression are prevalent in Afghanistan, causing severe negative outcomes among children. Promotion of mental health services, psychological training, awareness campaigns, acceptance of Afghan refugees, and initiatives to support re-connecting with loved ones, are among the many recommended measures needed to manage this alarming situation. This requires an immediate action plan from government and public health officials to mitigate this impending catastrophe.Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.

N2  - Background: Black women and their infants face heightened health risks during pregnancy, labor, and delivery that, for many, cost them their lives. Such health risks during this critical period are linked to increased rates of anxiety among Black pregnant and postpartum women. Black women also endure racism when seeking support from mental health and healthcare providers, which further contributes to pregnancy and postpartum-related anxiety. Evidence on sister circles has demonstrated that this indigenous form of healing may provide Black pregnant and postpartum women with the support and skills needed to cope with stressors associated with mental and physical health concerns and racism. Objective(s): Our study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the Birthing Beautiful Babies Sisters Offering Support, a sister circle cognitive behavioral therapy-based stress and anxiety intervention for Black pregnant and postpartum women. Design(s): Our study employed a mixed-methods framework. Method(s): Descriptive analyses, paired samples t-test, and open and selective coding were conducted. We utilized the following measures: Penn State Worry Questionnaire-Abbreviated, Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Scale, focus booklet, and focus group discussion. Result(s): Participants reported experiencing moderate levels of worry and distress and low levels of pregnancy-related anxiety prior to the start of the Birthing Beautiful Babies Sisters Offering Support intervention. Eighty women participated in Birthing Beautiful Babies Sisters Offering Support. Eleven focus groups were conducted to assess their experience. Participants reported a perceived increase in their knowledge about panic attacks and stress and ability to manage stressors effectively. They found that all completed activities contributed to their development and application of skills. They reported they enjoyed Birthing Beautiful Babies Sisters Offering Support because of the supportive environment, openness, and emphasis on sisterhood. Participants provided helpful feedback about the structure and flow of the intervention. Conclusion(s): Limitations of the present study and future directions are discussed.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Background: The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated the risk for poor physical and mental health outcomes among vulnerable older adults. Multicomponent interventions could potentially prevent or reduce the risk of becoming frail; however, there is limited evidence about utilizing alternative modes of delivery where access to in-person care may be challenging. This randomized feasibility trial aimed to understand how a multicomponent rehabilitation program can be delivered remotely to vulnerable older adults with frailty during the pandemic. Method(s): Participants were randomized to either a multimodal or socialization arm. Over a 12-week intervention period, the multimodal group received virtual care at home, which included twice-weekly exercise in small group physiotherapy-led live-streamed sessions, nutrition counselling and protein supplementation, medication consultation via a videoconference app, and once-weekly phone calls from student volunteers, while the socialization group received only once-weekly phone calls from the volunteers. The RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) framework was used to evaluate the feasibility of the program. The main clinical outcomes were change in the 5-times sit-to-stand test (5 x STS) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) scores. The feasibility outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics and expressed as frequencies and mean percent with corresponding confidence intervals (CI). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for the effectiveness component. Result(s): The program enrolled 33% (n = 72) of referrals to the study (n = 220), of whom 70 were randomized. Adoption rates from different referral sources were community self-referrals (60%), community organizations (33%), and healthcare providers (25%). At the provider level, implementation rates varied from 75 to 100% for different aspects of program delivery. Participant's adherence levels included virtual exercise sessions 81% (95% CI: 75-88%), home-based exercise 50% (95% CI: 38-62%), protein supplements consumption 68% (95% CI: 55-80%), and medication optimization 38% (95% CI: 21-59%). Most participants (85%) were satisfied with the program. There were no significant changes in clinical outcomes between the two arms. Conclusion(s): The GERAS virtual frailty rehabilitation study for community-dwelling older adults living with frailty was feasible in terms of reach of participants, adoption across referral settings, adherence to implementation, and participant's intention to maintain the program. This program could be feasibly delivered to improve access to socially isolated older adults where barriers to in-person participation exist. However, trials with larger samples and longer follow-up are required to demonstrate effectiveness and sustained behavior change. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04500366.

N2  - Workplace violence on health workers in the workplace causes physical and psychological problems. Negative impacts on victims of workplace violence such as physical problems, anxiety, depression, stress, and risk of death or risk of suicide. This problem needs to be addressed immediately so as not to impact post-traumatic stress disorder and reduce the work performance of health workers. The purpose of this study is to explore interventions to reduce the negative impact of workplace violence on health workers. This study used scoping review design with a descriptive approach to data analysis. The CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus databases were used in this investigation. This study used PCC's framework (Population, Content, Context). The keywords are workplace violence, healthcare personnel, interventions, and programs were used by the authors. Search strategy used PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. The sample are health workers, original research used a randomized control trial or quasi-experiment design, and the publication time had to be within the previous ten years (2014-2023). The JBI assessment was used to assess the quality of the article. We found 11 articles who discuss about interventions to reduce negative effects of workplace violence among health workers. This study shows that there is a decrease in psychological problems in victims of workplace violence such as anxiety, depression, and incidents of workplace violence. The range of sample in this study are 30-440 respondents. The authors discovered three different types of interventions: training programs, cognitive behavior therapy, and workplace violence programs. Interventions must focus on both the physical and psychological needs of the victims of workplace violence, psychiatric nurses and psychologists carried out interventions in a thorough manner. Interventions carried out by psychiatric nurses and psychologists can reduce the negative impact of workplace violence on health workers such as anxiety, depression and other psychological problems.Copyright © 2023 Yosep et al.

N2  - Background: Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the single most frequent reason for attendance at Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in Ireland. Research has suggested that parents of children with ADHD experience more parenting stress than parents of non-clinical controls, yet routine treatment for ADHD rarely addresses parental well-being. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been found to result in a reduction in parental stress. Method(s): An adapted Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention was delivered to parents (n = 23) of children with ADHD recruited from CAMHS and ADHD Ireland. Result(s): Following the intervention a significant improvement was documented within the social relationships domain of quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF) and a significant reduction on the child hyperactivity scale of the Strengths and Difficulties (SDQ) questionnaire. Conclusion(s): This pilot study suggests that an MBSR intervention is both feasible and effective for parents whose children have ADHD. Larger scale studies need to be conducted before inclusion in routine CAMHS.Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

N2  - We evaluated how an online post-traumatic growth program affected rumination, social support, and post-traumatic growth. We recruited 33 firefighters from two Korean provinces and employed a nonequivalent control group pretest-post-test design. We administered the pretest for the intervention group (n=16), consisting of eight sessions with an online workbook and messenger group counseling. We conducted post-tests immediately after the program and 4 weeks later. Post-traumatic growth and social support increased significantly. There were no statistically significant differences for intrusive or deliberate rumination. Psychological support programs should be developed to reflect firefighters' work characteristics and needs, including programs designed to induce rumination.

N2  - Background: Patients with psoriasis show an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms that worsen disease out-comes. This study investigated the effect of resilience and other sociodemographic/clinical variables on depressive symptoms' severity in patients with psoriasis. Method(s): This study included 58 psoriasis patients consecutively enrolled during the 14 months of the study. We evalu-ated psoriasis severity using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, Body Surface Area, and Physician Global Assess-ment. The psychometric assessment included the Resilience Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). We divided participants into two subgroups based on the optimal BDI-II cut-off score (Group A: BDI-II <=17; Group B: BDI-II >17). A stepwise regression analysis explored whether the variation in the BDI-II score could be predicted by a linear combination of sociodemographic and clinical variables. Result(s): Psoriasis patients with more severe depressive symptoms (Group B patients) showed lower resilience levels than Group A patients (p <0.001). Moreover, depressive symptoms correlated only with resilience levels (p <0.001), with a negative correlation. The stepwise regression analysis revealed that resilience explained 37.1 % of the variance in BDI-II scores, whereas resilience, gender, and comorbidity with other physical illnesses combined explained 51.3 % of the variance. Conclusion(s): Resilience may alleviate depressive symptoms in psoriasis patients. This study underscores the importance of resilience-building interventions for these patients.

N2  - Objective This study explores sources of stress, conditions that help reduce stress levels and coping strategies among parents of children with cancer receiving chemotherapy at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH) in Ethiopia. Design A qualitative phenomenological approach was used. Setting Parents of children receiving chemotherapy at the TASH paediatric oncology unit. Participants Fifteen semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted with nine mothers and six fathers of children with cancer from November 2020 to January 2021. Results Sources of stress related to child's health condition as the severity of the child's illness, fear of treatment side effects and loss of body parts were identified. Parents mentioned experiencing stress arising from limited access to health facilities, long waiting times, prolonged hospital stays, lack of chemotherapy drugs, and limited or inadequate information about their child's disease condition and treatment. Other sources of stress were insufficient social support, stigmatisation of cancer and financial problems. Conditions decreasing parents' stress included positive changes in the child's health, receiving cancer treatment and access to drugs. Receiving counselling from healthcare providers, getting social support and knowing someone who had a positive treatment outcome also helped reduce stress. Coping strategies used by parents were religious practices including prayer, crying, accepting the child's condition, denial and communication with health providers. Conclusion The main causes of stress identified by parents of children with cancer in Ethiopia were the severity of their child's illness, expectations of poor treatment outcomes, unavailability of cancer treatment services and lack of social/financial support. Measures that should be considered to reduce parents' stress include providing psycho-oncological care for parents and improving the counselling available to parents concerning the nature of the child's illness, its treatment, diagnostic procedures and treatment side effects. It may also be helpful to establish and strengthen family support groups and parent-to-parent communication, improve the availability of chemotherapy drugs and offer more education on coping strategies.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

N2  - Background: Mental health problems are common among people with diabetes. However, evidence-based strategies for the prevention and early intervention of emotional problems in people with diabetes are lacking. Our aim is to assess the real-world effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and implementation of a Low-Intensity mental health Support via a Telehealth Enabled Network (LISTEN), facilitated by diabetes health professionals (HPs). Method(s): A hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation trial, including a two-arm parallel randomised controlled trial, alongside mixed methods process evaluation. Recruited primarily via the National Diabetes Services Scheme, Australian adults with diabetes (N = 454) will be eligible if they are experiencing elevated diabetes distress. Participants are randomised (1:1 ratio) to LISTEN-a brief, low-intensity mental health support program based on a problem-solving therapy framework and delivered via telehealth (intervention) or usual care (web-based resources about diabetes and emotional health). Data are collected via online assessments at baseline (T0), 8 weeks (T1) and 6 months (T2, primary endpoint) follow-up. The primary outcome is between-group differences in diabetes distress at T2. Secondary outcomes include the immediate (T1) and longer-term (T2) effect of the intervention on psychological distress, general emotional well-being, and coping self-efficacy. A within-trial economic evaluation will be conducted. Implementation outcomes will be assessed using mixed methods, according to the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Data collection will include qualitative interviews and field notes. Discussion(s): It is anticipated that LISTEN will reduce diabetes distress among adults with diabetes. The pragmatic trial results will determine whether LISTEN is effective, cost-effective, and should be implemented at scale. Qualitative findings will be used to refine the intervention and implementation strategies as required. Trial registration: This trial has been registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN: ACTRN12622000168752) on 1 February, 2022.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Cancer patients experience various forms of psychological distress. Their distress, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety, leads to poor quality of life, increased medical spending due to frequent visits, and decrease in treatment adherence. It is estimated that 30-50% among them would require support from mental health professionals: in reality, much less actually receive such support partly due to a shortage of qualified professionals and also due to psychological barriers in seeking such help. The purpose of the present study is to develop the easily accessible and the most efficient and effective smartphone psychotherapy package to alleviate depression and anxiety in cancer patients. Method(s): Based on the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework, the SMartphone Intervention to LEssen depression/Anxiety and GAIN resilience project (SMILE-AGAIN project) is a parallel-group, multicenter, open, stratified block randomized, fully factorial trial with four experimental components: psychosocial education (PE), behavioral activation (BA), assertion training (AT), and problem-solving therapy (PS). The allocation sequences are maintained centrally. All participants receive PE and then are randomized to the presence/absence of the remaining three components. The primary outcome of this study is the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) total score, which will be administered as an electronic patient-reported outcome on the patients' smartphones after 8 weeks. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nagoya City University on July 15, 2020 (ID: 46-20-0005). The randomized trial, which commenced in March 2021, is currently enrolling participants. The estimated end date for this study is March 2023. Discussion(s): The highly efficient experimental design will allow for the identification of the most effective components and the most efficient combinations among the four components of the smartphone psychotherapy package for cancer patients. Given that many cancer patients face significant psychological hurdles in seeing mental health professionals, easily accessible therapeutic interventions without hospital visits may offer benefits. If an effective combination of psychotherapy is determined in this study, it can be provided using smartphones to patients who cannot easily access hospitals or clinics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Burnout disproportionately affects female physicians and contributes to negative long term outcomes. While physicians typically score higher in grit, resilience, and other adaptive qualities, they often report more self-condemnation and less self-compassion compared with other fields. Low self-compassion contributes to burnout and likely stems from perfectionism, negativity biases, and frequent comparison. Many burnout interventions have no or marginal effect on burnout. Little is known about their long-term impact. We piloted Better Together Physician Coaching (BT), a group coaching program focusing on self-compassion for female-identifying residents at the University of Colorado in an RCT which reduced burnout and imposter syndrome and increased self-compassion. Here, we evaluate long-term effects of BT. METHOD(S): The BT program guides participants through the application of a metacognitive tool while grounding them in a psychologically safe space of non-judgement and self-compassion. We performed a secondary analysis of survey data from the pilot program implementation between January 2021 and June 2022. Two-sample t-tests between baseline and post-6 months and baseline and post-12 month results were completed for outcome measures. RESULT(S): Of 101 participants, 95 completed a baseline survey (94%), 66 completed a 6-month survey (69%) and 36 completed a 12-month survey (38%). No statistically significant differences were observed when comparing baseline to 6 months or baseline to 12 months scores in emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, or personal accomplishment. Compared to baseline self-compassion [mean = 33.2, SD= 6.74], participant scores significantly improved after 6 months (mean = 38.2 SD = 7.79, p < .001) which remained still significantly improved after 12 months (mean = 36.7, SD = 7.59, p = .020). Impostor syndrome scores improved significantly from baseline to 6 months (mean = 5.41 SD = 2.00 versus mean = 4.38 SD=2.37 respectively, p = .005) but were not sustained after 12 months (mean = 4.66 SD = 2.18, p = .081). Moral injury (mean = 41.2, SD = 10.7), scores improved after 6 months (M = 37.0, SD = 11.0, p = .018) but did not remain at 12 months (M = 38.1, SD = 11.1, p = .166). CONCLUSION(S): This study showed significant, sustained improvement in self-compassion for BT participants. In the pilot RCT, BT mitigated the otherwise worsening burnout in residents over time. A lack of self-compassion has been linked to worsening burnout, sleep-related impairment, and a habit of deferring self-care. Furthermore, medical training often responds to mistakes with approaches which frame selfcompassion as unnecessary or counterproductive. Reframing this belief about self-compassion and then teaching hands-on tools to create and protect self-compassion is foundational to the BT program, perhaps attributing to its sustained longitudinal self-compassion improvement in participating residents.

T1  - ADVANCING HEALTH EQUITY EDUCATION: TEACHING INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENTS THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN SOCIAL SERVICES SYSTEMS AND TRAUMA
T3  - Annual Meeting of the Society of General Internal Medicine, SGIM 2023. Aurora, CO United States.

N2  - SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This lecture was part of a didactic curriculum on health equity that included 6 required lectures which took place over the 2021-2022 academic year as part of our outpatient curriculum for Internal Medicine (IM) residents at an academic medical center. Our center hosts the largest IM residency program in the city and our major outpatient primary care resident practice serves high number of patients with social need (73% Medicare, Medicaid, or dual eligible). DESCRIPTION: In our initial curriculum we focused on social determinants of health, impact on health outcomes, and advocacy skills. Some residents disclosed increased hopelessness surrounding the care of marginalized patients in feedback on this curriculum. Previous literature describes the bueracratic oppression of individuals through social services systems and the obligation of clinicians to pathologize social problems in order to assist their patients in obtaining benefits that allow for their survival (Lipsky, 1980, Hansen et al., 2014). In order to attempt to tackle some of the experience of hopelessness in this setting, we set out to create a lecture that addressed the traumatic experience implicated in navigating the bueracracy of poverty for both patients and clinicians. We hypothesized that giving residents the practical tools to address patient needs efficiently and the language to address suffering in this setting would allow them to feel more comfortable serving patients with high social need. EVALUATION: A physician and clinical psychologist partnered to enhance the health equity curriculum by integrating trauma informated care content. We measured efforts in a mid-year lecture most strongly reflective of our efforts titled: "Social suffering through 'street level bureaucracy' and resilience". We collected data pre- and post-lecture from residents (n = 59) regarding their knowledge about our local governmental social services, disability paperwork, and understanding of impact of trauma on healthcare engagement using a 1-10 Likert scale. Two-tailed t-test results showed statistically significant improvements in resident self-reported knowledge regarding social services (p < .001), increased comfort completing paperwork for the social services agency (p < .001), and increased understanding of impact of trauma on patient healthcare engagement (p < .01) (pre-lecture response rate = 95%; post-lecture response rate = 98%). We received multiple detailed comments (n=7), all of which used the thematic term "helpful." DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: At times social barriers may be a higher priority for our patients than medication management. We identified that it was possible to integrate trauma informed care into discussion surrounding social suffering and that residents found this practical information on language to use and forms to complete "helpful" for the very real patients they would face. Next steps include considering mechanisms to test not just self-reported knowledge but also resident skills and abilities on this topic.

T1  - LOOKING, SEEING, AND FEELING: THE USE OF ART DURING ROUNDS TO PROMOTE TRAINEE WELLNESS ON THE WARDS
T3  - Annual Meeting of the Society of General Internal Medicine, SGIM 2023. Aurora, CO United States.

N2  - SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Attending physician sits down with their inpatient team at the start of rounds to discuss art for 10-15 minutes. The art can be digital or printed depending on setting. DESCRIPTION: The 2022 CLER report found the "pandemic has adversely affected clinical care team well being." Promoting wellness, therefore, is tantamount but we need to find practical and consistent ways to do it. The uniqueness of this intervention is it's done daily inside the hospital as part of rounds. Using social constructivist theory to facilitate discussions, the goal of this intervention is to promote wellness through the medium of art. Following are examples that have been used: * The Castle is a mixed media sculpture by Jorge Mendes Blake. He constructed a brick wall that sits atop "The Castle," a book by Franz Kafka. As you zoom out, you see how this seemingly inconsequently object has changed the entire facade of the wall. Once team members discuss what they see, the facilitator asks, "One single thing can change the entire facade of the wall, so what is the one thing each team member is going to work on this week?" It's a great way to focus a trainee on a specific skill set rather than them feeling overwhelmed by all the things they need to work on. * A Twilight poster is used to discuss the concept of a "human minute." For the uninitiated, Edward is a vampire and Bella is a human. This means Edward is much stronger and faster, and at some point, Bells says, "I need a human minute." This art works very well on a call day when you know the team is going to be extremely busy. The facilitator asks the team what each member will do to take a "human minute" for themselves (i.e. a Starbucks break, hydrate, attend conference, etc). This allows trainees to reframe their day to incorporate wellness despite the chaos. * Lucian Freud's "Fat Sue," a painting of a morbidly obese woman lying naked on a couch is shown side by side with the "Naked Maja" by Goya, a painting of a thin woman lying similarly on a couch. Trainees are asked to discuss differences, and the facilitator uses this to elicit "uncomfortable truths" in medicine. Prior discussions focused on chronic pain management, end of life conversations, discharging patients with poor support systems. EVALUATION: Trainees evaluated "Art of the Day" segment in their end of rotation evaluation. Next round will use a pre and post Likert Scale filled out by trainees to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness in promoting wellness. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Medical training regardless of stage is very stressful, and wellness can feel like a mirage despite our best intentions. We need to recognize that wellness is multi-faceted, and includes promoting connectedness, self reflection/ introspection, self-care, and resilience. Trainees consistently said that "Art of the Day" segment was an easy and accessible way to initiate open dialogue on all those fronts and bring wellness to the forefront despite the stress of their daily working environment.

N2  - SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Undergraduate Medical Education in the Mid-Atlantic Region. DESCRIPTION: In 2020, the Society for General Internal Medicine issued a new call for action to address social determinants of health (SDOH), asking educators to "ensure social and relational competency for future physicians by developing curricula with SDOH at every stage of education and evaluation." Those charged with teaching SDOH to future physicians, however, face a paucity of curricular guidance. Very few medical schools provide robust community-engaged medical curricula to train students formally how to address social determinants of health in clinical practice. Our academic institution developed the Voices Program, a required longitudinal undergraduate medical education program embedded within the innovative Human Dimension course. A key component of the curriculum matches student dyads with individuals (Voices Participants or VPs) from historically marginalized and under-invested communities to develop a longitudinal relationship over a series of home visits during the 3 year curriculum. This relationship helps students understand the main drivers of health outcomes by bringing the SDOH to life, while providing health coaching support to the family. Students are prepared for these community experiences through a variety of educational sessions including large group learning sessions, facilitated small group discussions, reflection activities, and community-based assignments. The students are provided knowledge and skills for cultural humility, health equity and health coaching, then apply these concepts as they work to help their VPs. Small group reflection and mentorship activities led by faculty are used to debrief these community experiences and prompt students to think critically about how to address SDOH and become change agents through advocacy. EVALUATION: The majority of students surveyed reported that the Voices Program was the most valuable part of their community engaged curriculum experience. Students reported growth in their understanding of determinants of health, their ability to collaborate their own humanism, cultural humility and skills necessary to promote equity . DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: A distinguishing feature of the Human Dimension Voices Program is the longitudinal integration across the entire curricula, from basic science integration to the integration into the clinical setting via clerkship curricula. Students note that the program is an extremely valuable component of their medical education. They report growth in understanding determinants of health, cultural humility, humanism, and equity- promoting skills while providing meaningful service to the community. Faculty-led small group sessions focused on the reflection and processing of community experiences was universally cited by students as a key part of their learning experience.This program is an effective way for students to learn health system science while developing a professional identity rooted in humanism and resilience.

N2  - Background: In March 2022, a COVID-19 associated lockdown in Shanghai, China resulted in a stoppage of production of GE Health care's intravenous (IV) contrast, resulting in global supply shortages by May 2022 (1,2). The ensuing impact to the supply chain required health care facilities to develop triage systems to ensure optimal allocation of limited supply (3). Objective(s): We report our experience in a comprehensive cancer center navigating the IV contrast shortage to best serve our patients through extensive organizational effort and the development of an IV contrast triage team. Method(s): On May 10, 2022, an institutional notification requested ordering clinicians to re-consider IV contrast use due to impending shortage. However, this initiative did not result in a significant reduction in utilization, and the determination was made for complete stoppage of routine contrast use. All requests would be reviewed by an interdisciplinary team. The contrast triage team reviewed cases from May 17, 2022, through June 3, 2022, at which point it was felt that sufficient supply had been procured. Based on worst-case estimates of the shortage, we determined that we could safely allow 10-15 contrast studies per day to ensure that supply would be available for critically important operations. A triage prioritization system was established to serve as a guideline for ordering clinicians (Table 1). Category 1 studies would be certainly approved, category 2 would likely be approved, category 3 would likely not be approved, and category 4 would certainly not be approved. The triage team considered the overall utility of contrast based on patient history, treatment plan, prior imaging, possible alternative modalities, and competing requests. Result(s): Our department performed a median of 194 CT studies per day. Contrast utilization as a percentage of all CTs ordered was approximately 80% prior to the shortage, nadired at 9% during peak shortage, and has since returned to pre-shortage levels (Figure 1). While most requests were changed to non-contrast by the ordering clinician, 132 requests were reviewed by the triage team. Fifty studies (38%) were approved by the team for contrast administration, 56 (42%) were recommended to be performed without contrast, 15 (11%) for a change in modality, and 11 (8%) were felt suitable for delay. There was overall general concordance between the recommendations of the triage team and studies conducted without significant distributional differences (chi2 = 4.004, two-tailed P = 0.2610). We did not note any instances of patient harm associated with the lack of contrast or from the utilization of an alternative imaging modality. There were a total of 10 patients who had alternative imaging performed, and in 3 patients, additional subtle findings were detected that may not have otherwise been detected in standard contrast imaging (subtle uptake in lymph nodes on PET/CT, more careful delineation of tumor response on MRI). It does not appear that the detection of these additional findings made a difference in clinical management or patient outcome. We are not aware of any instances of patient harm associated with the shortage. Conclusion(s): The concept of resilience involves the development system- based practices that allow for sustained operations during periods of sudden change, or loss of critical supplies. The effort to optimally allocate limited supply of contrast was an extensive effort across the organization including from senior leadership, IT, radiology, nursing, physicians, and APPs. Defaulting to an automatic cancelation of contrast requests, followed by review from an interdisciplinary triage team was effective in safely reducing contrast utilization. Decisions made by the team appeared to be sound without any known patient harm. Such a triage model could be used in other shortages of critical supplies that are essential to daily operations.

N2  - Introduction Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy worldwide. Chemotherapy, one of the major treatment modalities widely used for BC, is accompanied by psycho-educational needs. mHealth, which refers to health-related interventions delivered through mobile communication devices, has been suggested as an efective means to support this cohort. This study aimed to test the feasibility and acceptability of the ChEmoNurse Breast cancer App (CENBA) programme to provide psychoeducational support for Nigerian women receiving chemotherapy for BC. Methods An assessor-blinded multi-centre pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted among 30 women from two tertiary hospitals in Nigeria using the CENBA programme developed by the research team. The CENBA programme is a mHealth psychoeducational intervention with four major components: BC education, coping skills training, discussion forum, and nurse-led consultation. Evidence for designing the programme was obtained from a systematic review and qualitative study by the research team. Participants in the intervention group received the CENBA programme over six weeks, while those in the control group received usual care. Study outcomes included selfefcacy, coping, symptom distress and interference, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Individual interviews were conducted with the participants in the intervention group post-intervention. Results Fourteen women in the intervention group completed the CENBA programme. There was a statistically significant diference in self-efcacy, coping, and the social well-being domain of the quality of life between the intervention and control groups (p<0.05); however, other outcomes were not significantly diferent. Overall, the participants highly valued the intervention. Conclusions This study suggests that the CENBA programme might be efective in providing psychoeducational support to this population. To confrm the efectiveness, we recommend that the intervention be further tested through an RCT using a larger sample size with modifications of the intervention according to the pilot RCT results.

N2  - Introduction Patients in protective isolation units for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT) experience extreme physical and mental limitations and become anxious due to uncertainty about the future. To relieve their stress and anxiety, adequate nursing interventions are necessary. This study was conducted to develop a program that can improve patients resilience and present them with new perspectives on life by managing their uncertainty and distress, using the key concepts presented by Elphee (2008)'s uncertainty theory. Methods The development and clinical application evaluation process of the program followed the five stages based on the ADDIE model. Program development was carried out through the analysis, design, and development stages, and clinical application evaluation was attempted through the implementation and evaluation stages. Results In the analysis stage, a literature review was conducted to assess the contents of supportive nursing interventions for HSCT patients, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 patients and 12 nurses. In the design stage, the theme, goal, content, and activity were planned for six session program. In the development stage, the program was revised through validity verifcation by five experts-the six session program comprised a selfchecklist, video materials, handouts, writing, and interviews. In the implementation stage, a quasi-experimental study with a singlegroup before-and-after design was conducted with 31 patients undergoing HSCT in Korea from February 17 to May 31 2022, to clinically evaluate the program. We were analyzed uncertainty, uncertainty appraisal, distress, resilience, and growth for new life. The program was found to significantly reduce uncertainty (t=4.77, p=<.000) and improve resilience (t=-2.93, p=.006). In the evaluation stage, the fnal program was a nurse-led uncertainty intervention program for HSCT patients, developed for six sessions, 20-30 minutes per session. Conclusions Program is expected to provide standardized supportive nursing intervention, solve nursing problems, and help nurses lead and provide active intervention for patients improved quality of life.

T1  - What effect does treating cancer patients have on radiation therapy students' identity development?
A1  - Dungey G.M. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - The aim of this research was to determine what effect treating cancer patients has on the ability of radiation therapy students to develop their own identity. It is important that radiation therapists have a sense of self so they can enter fully into relationships with patients and other health professionals, and develop sound coping mechanisms to face the challenges of the clinical environment. This research was conducted utilising a qualitative case study approach, with a class of 30 Year Two young adult radiation therapy students. Twenty-one of the 30 students completed an open-ended questionnaire. The research findings show that this cohort of radiation therapy students is developing a new set of values, beliefs and goals, partially as a result of their interactions with cancer patients. Four main themes were identified: concern for family and friends, emotional aspects of treating cancer patients, the feeling of a sense of pride in their profession and a development of a greater awareness of themselves as individuals. Using the criteria of identity developed by James Marcia, some students expressed a strong sense of who they are as an individual with a sense of identity. However, for others, the clinical experience has caused them to actively struggle for a sense of who they are as a person as they searched for ways to cope. This research suggests that strategies such as counselling, supervision or mentorship could be useful for radiation therapy students so they can explore their feelings and be able to implement appropriate coping mechanisms.Copyright © 2009 Australian Society of Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy.

N2  - Background: Healthcare is a complex socio-technical system where nations regularly struggle with the misalignment between public needs and available resources. The advent of COVID-19 further exacerbated shortcomings, as evidenced by the global panic to find ventilators and beyond. However, the pandemic catalysed a successful Brazilian public-private voluntary partnership that united key industry players, industrial training centres and several volunteers, who, in the absence of a supportive government, could repair ventilators in record time, giving the health system means to succeed. Objective(s): Characterise how a voluntary public-private partnership came into existence and codify recommendations on how it effectively used repair as a circular strategy to increase ventilator availability and bolster health system resilience. Method(s): Case study using multiple data sources collected over 10 months, including national data, semi-structured interviews, daily reports, and internal communications. Sampling, research instruments, and subsequent qualitative data analysis and theory development grounded in repair strategy, resilience, and supply chain literature. Result(s): A successful public-private voluntary partnership delivered 2,514 repaired ventilators, approximately 3% of the total ventilators in use in Brazil and impacting around 24,700 lives. Furthermore, effectively functioned as a first-responder bringing to hospitals approximately 500 repaired units as early as April 2020, surpassing the government's procurement and doing so just-in-time for Brazil's COVID 1st wave. More than 70 institutions and 700 professionals helped hospitals in 25 out of 27 Brazilian states. This case documents how the initiative persevered through adversity, including inadequate policies representing a widespread difficulty in enforcing the "right to repair". Public interest summary: In Brazil, automakers, the National Industrial Training Service and other organisations formed a voluntary and temporary alliance to repair broken ventilators that had accumulated in hospitals. This initiative took place at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and returned 2,514 ventilators to hospitals, supporting patient care and partially alleviating the shortage of ventilators. This repair depended on the training of technical staff who had never worked with health equipment before. In addition to training, there was a need to share information and manuals, calibrate repaired equipment, procure spare parts, organise logistics and find funding, amongst other activities, meaning that it was a wide scale operation involving several organisations - both within and outside the health system. This research demonstrates the role of ventilator repair in making a health system more resilient in the event of a health emergency, and the urgent need to develop strategies to make repair an everyday commitment.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Objective: To inform approaches to pediatric medical traumatic stress (PMTS) by exploring providers' (1) perception of the impact of PMTS on the medical care of patients with pediatric-onset chronic illnesses, (2) self-reported competencies and practices of PMTS prevention, treatment, and counseling, and (3) perception of the barriers influencing the adoption of these practices. Study design: A convenience sample of multidisciplinary healthcare providers was recruited through a multimodal recruitment strategy to participate in an electronic survey adapted from the Trauma-Informed Care Provider Survey. Result(s): Among participants (n = 304), 99% agreed that PMTS impacts patient health. Participants report altering medical care plans due to PMTS, including deferring or stopping treatments (n = 98 [32%]) and changing medication regimens (n = 88 [29%]). Sixty-eight percent (n = 208) report negative impact of PMTS on patient implementation of medical care plans, including medication nonadherence (n = 153 [50%]) and missed appointments (n = 119 [39%]). Although participants agreed it is their job to decrease patient stress (n = 292 [96%]) and perform PMTS assessments (n = 268 [88%]), few practiced PMTS-focused trauma informed care. Systems-level barriers to practice included insufficient training, absent clinical workflows, and lack of access to mental health experts. Conclusion(s): Our findings have helped inform a conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between PMTS and health outcomes. Systems-level opportunities to optimize PMTS-focused trauma-informed care include (1) dissemination of provider training, (2) integrated workflows for PMTS mitigation, and (3) enhanced accessibility to mental health providers. Further work is required to determine if these interventions can improve health outcomes in patients with pediatric-onset chronic illnesses.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Background: Between 40 and 50% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience anxiety and depression, associated with impaired physical function, high care dependency and mortality. Recently, the United States National Institutes of Health has urged the implementation of mindfulness practices in chronic illness care. Most research to date has examined the effects on chronically ill patients of complex interventions using a combination of mindfulness techniques. In PD patients, however, such complex modalities appear to hinder the technique mastery. Hence, the aim of this trial is to investigate the effects and underlying mechanism of individual mindfulness techniques among PD patients, as well as exploring participants' experience in using individual mindfulness techniques as a lifestyle intervention for stress and symptom management. Method(s): We will conduct an assessor-blind three-arm randomized waitlist-controlled trial with a descriptive qualitative evaluation. Up to 168 PD patients will be recruited from community settings and out-patient clinics, and randomized to meditation, yoga, or usual care group. Meditation and yoga sessions of 90-minute are held weekly for 8 weeks. Primary outcomes include anxiety and depression. Secondary outcomes include PD-related motor and non-motor symptoms and quality-of-life; and level of mindfulness and biomarkers of stress and inflammatory responses will be measured as mediating variables. All outcome evaluations will be assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, and 24 weeks. Following the intention-to-treat principle, generalized estimating equation models and path analysis will be used to identify the treatment effects and the mediating mechanisms. A subsample of 30 participants from each intervention group will be invited for qualitative interviews. Discussion(s): The study would also generate important insights to enhance the patients' adaptation to debilitating disease. More specifically, symptom management and stress adaptation are highly prioritized healthcare agenda in managing PD. The research evidence will further inform the development of community-based, nurse-led compassionate care models for neurodegenerative conditions, which is complementary to existing health services.

N2  - Snakebite is a public health problem in many countries, with India having the highest number of deaths. Not much is known about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on snakebite care. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with those bitten by venomous snakes through the two waves of COVID-19 (March-May 2020; May-November 2021), their caregivers, health care workers and social workers in two areas (Sundarbans and Hooghly) of West Bengal, India. We used a constructivist approach and conducted a thematic analysis. We identified the following themes: 1. Snakebite continued to be recognised as an acute emergency during successive waves of COVID-19; 2. COVID-19 magnified the financial woes of communities with high snakebite burden; 3. The choice of health care provider was driven by multiple factors and consideration of trade-offs, many of which leaned toward use of traditional providers during COVID-19; 4. Rurality, financial and social disadvantage and cultural safety, in and beyond the health system, affected snakebite care; 5. There is strong and shared felt need for multi-faceted community programs on snakebite. We mapped factors affecting snakebite care in the three-delay model (decision to seek care, reaching appropriate health facility, receiving appropriate care), originally developed for maternal mortality. The result of our study contextualises and brings forth evidence on impact of COVID-19 on snakebite care in West Bengal, India. Multi-faceted community programs, are needed for addressing factors affecting snakebite care, including during disease outbreaks - thus improving health systems resilience. Community programs for increasing formal health service usage, should be accompanied by health systems strengthening, instead of an exclusive focus on awareness against traditional providers.Copyright © 2023 The Authors

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - The mental health of professionals was under pressure during- and post-pandemic. Initially, the focus was mainly on the health workers in the hospitals, but over time the pressure shifted to other sectors, including mental health care. An increase in workload and decrease in mental health of healthcare professionals in mental health care can lead to a decrease in the available care capacity. In an earlier online survey of mental health professionals, 1,300 professionals from a large number of mental healthcare institutions were involved. In this study, conducted in September 2021, about half of the respondents reported increased levels of stress. Feelings of anxiety, anger, and sadness were also increasingly experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, 4.2% replied that they were considering resigning their jobs. One of the recommendations of this previous study was to monitor these professionals repeatedly to be able to make an estimate of the stress and vision of work during the course of the pandemic and afterwards. Following this recommendation, the online survey was repeated. The aim of the current online longitudinal follow-up study was to re-evaluated mental status of healthcare workers. 510 healthcare workers participated in this follow-up survey. The reported mental health complaints were significantly higher during compared to post-pandemic. Respondents were less able to maintain work/life balance during the pandemic and even reported a shift to work. However, the majority of respondents indicated that they had restored this balance post-pandemic. Moreover, more sick leave was reported post-pandemic than during the pandemic and more frequent absences post-pandemic. This highlights the importance of focusing on resilience over training and career.Copyright © 2023 de Vroege and van den Broek.

N2  - Background: Care partners of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) must continually cope with various stressors due to changes resulting from the disease process, including assisting and supporting with their medical, emotional, and social needs. Caregivers' expectations, preferences, and experiences on PD management are a cornerstone to guarantee a comprehensive treatment of the disease and may be influenced or determined by cultural backgrounds. Method(s): Comprehensive literature review to investigate the roles, experiences, and needs of caregivers of PwPD across cultures. We critically reviewed and analyzed the all published studies that examined the impact of cultural diversity on caregiving in PD. Result(s): Among some significant results, we found profound differences in caregivers' experiences and perceptions between U.S, Mexican, and Latin-American, Asian, African and Indian caregivers. There are clear negative reinforced effects between caregiver status, education, health, labor participation and income-generating capacity, and social protection combined with the age and gender differences. Canadian information was not available. Conclusion(s): There is still a gap in the literature with a need for social and health services to understand the cultural factors that impact caregiver burden in PD to facilitate wellbeing and support from health and social services to better aid those in the caregiver role.

N2  - An epidemic of mental health concerns is apparent within the collegiate environment. These concerns are more prevalent during examination periods where stress and anxiety may be heightened. Many students struggle to find ways to cope with this additional anxiety. Data have shown a rise in on-campus substance abuse, emphasizing the urgent need for campuses to offer alternative approaches to cope with the stresses associated with academia. Studies have demonstrated equine interaction in an academic setting can improve life skills important for coping with the rigors of academics. While the benefits of consistent equine interaction have been reported, the impact of equine interaction on coping skills valuable for managing test anxiety for college students have yet to be studied. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of short-term equine interaction on perceived stress and coping skills development during the college examination period. Full-time college students (n = 27; Males = 3, Females = 24) engaged in a 1-h equine interaction session held on campus at the onset of final exam week (Fall 2022). College equine facilities staff and faculty conducted the sessions which consisted of grooming, leading, and grazing. Participants were given at the equine facility a 14-question survey instrument within 5 minpre- and post- equine interaction. Survey was developed working with mental health professionals associated with campus counseling services with questions formatted to follow standard mental health questionnaires targeting personal perception of stress levels and life skills associated with coping with test anxiety. Data were analyzed using a 2-tailed t-test to determine the significance of self-reported measures pre- and post- equine interaction with significance set at P <= 0.05. Participants (67%) reported moderate to high levels of anxiety surrounding grades and upcoming examinations, and yet, perceived anxiety levels following equine interaction were significantly reduced (93% reporting none to very low stress levels; P < 0.001). Perceived improvements were reported by participants in the following coping skills after equine interaction: focus (P = 0.008), self-efficacy in goal pursuit (P = 0.006), patience (P = 0.017), and calmness (P < 0.001). These perceived acquired coping skills lend themselves well to academic success. These skills coupled with decreased perceived test anxiety suggest the potential of collegiate equine interaction programs may be of benefit to students during high stress periods within the academic year.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Importance: Military deployment involves significant risk for life-threatening experiences that can lead to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Accurate predeployment prediction of PTSD risk may facilitate the development of targeted intervention strategies to enhance resilience. Objective(s): To develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model to predict postdeployment PTSD. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This diagnostic/prognostic study included 4771 soldiers from 3 US Army brigade combat teams who completed assessments between January 9, 2012, and May 1, 2014. Predeployment assessments occurred 1 to 2 months before deployment to Afghanistan, and follow-up assessments occurred approximately 3 and 9 months post deployment. Machine learning models to predict postdeployment PTSD were developed in the first 2 recruited cohorts using as many as 801 predeployment predictors from comprehensive self-report assessments. In the development phase, cross-validated performance metrics and predictor parsimony were considered to select an optimal model. Next, the selected model's performance was evaluated with area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and expected calibration error in a temporally and geographically distinct cohort. Data analyses were performed from August 1 to November 30, 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis was assessed by clinically calibrated self-report measures. Participants were weighted in all analyses to address potential biases related to cohort selection and follow-up nonresponse. Result(s): This study included 4771 participants (mean [SD] age, 26.9 [6.2] years), 4440 (94.7%) of whom were men. In terms of race and ethnicity, 144 participants (2.8%) identified as American Indian or Alaska Native, 242 (4.8%) as Asian, 556 (13.3%) as Black or African American, 885 (18.3%) as Hispanic, 106 (2.1%) as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 3474 (72.2%) as White, and 430 (8.9%) as other or unknown race or ethnicity; participants could identify as of more than 1 race or ethnicity. A total of 746 participants (15.4%) met PTSD criteria post deployment. In the development phase, models had comparable performance (log loss range, 0.372-0.375; area under the curve range, 0.75-0.76). A gradient-boosting machine with 58 core predictors was selected over an elastic net with 196 predictors and a stacked ensemble of ML models with 801 predictors. In the independent test cohort, the gradient-boosting machine had an area under the curve of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.71-0.77) and low expected calibration error of 0.032 (95% CI, 0.020-0.046). Approximately one-third of participants with the highest risk accounted for 62.4% (95% CI, 56.5%-67.9%) of the PTSD cases. Core predictors cut across 17 distinct domains: stressful experiences, social network, substance use, childhood or adolescence, unit experiences, health, injuries, irritability or anger, personality, emotional problems, resilience, treatment, anxiety, attention or concentration, family history, mood, and religion. Conclusions and Relevance: In this diagnostic/prognostic study of US Army soldiers, an ML model was developed to predict postdeployment PTSD risk with self-reported information collected before deployment. The optimal model showed good performance in a temporally and geographically distinct validation sample. These results indicate that predeployment stratification of PTSD risk is feasible and may facilitate the development of targeted prevention and early intervention strategies..Copyright © 2023 American Medical Association.

N2  - Background: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, immune-mediated condition associated with abdominal pain, psychological comorbidities, and reduced quality of life (QoL), even in remission. Clinical hypnosis, involving focused relaxation and therapeutic suggestion, is helpful for irritable bowel syndrome, pain, and anxiety, and may have anti-inflammatory effects. Study Aims: To implement hypnosis as an adjunctive therapy for adolescents with CD. To assess the impact on QoL, abdominal pain, psychosocial measures, and disease activity compared to standard care. Method(s): Forty 12-18 year-olds with CD diagnosed >3 months prior randomized to hypnosis intervention (HI) or waitlist control (WC). HI receive one in-person hypnosis session focused on enhancing comfort, calm, and energy; education on self-hypnosis; audio recordings for 8 weeks home practice. Assessments at 8 and 16 weeks. Primary Outcome: disease-specific health-related (HR) QoL Impact III, single- item QoL modified Cantril Scale, parent-proxy HRQoL PedsQL 4.0. Secondary Outcomes: Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Sleep Disturbance (PROMIS pediatric short forms); abdominal pain frequency and intensity; Pain Beliefs Questionnaire short form (PBQ-SF); school absences; healthcare utilization; Physician's Global Assessment (PGA); Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index. With n=40, 80% power to detect 13-point difference in Impact III. Two-sided Wilcoxon test used to compare differences from baseline to follow up and between groups. Result(s): Demographics: 40 participants enrolled February-May 2019. 50% female. 15.8 y +/- 2. PGA: 28 quiescent, 6 mild, 3 moderate, 3 not documented. 18, 8, and 13 of 40 with moderate-severe depressive symptoms, anxiety, and sleep disturbance, respectively. 25 of 40 with abdominal pain in the past week. WC with poorer systemic symptom-related QoL by Impact III (p=0.01) and greater depressive symptoms (p=0.03) compared to HI. Post-Intervention (8 Weeks): In HI and not in WC, significant improvement was noted in parent-reported QoL (p=0.006; Figure 1), maximum abdominal pain intensity (p=0.01, Figure 2), PBQ-SF subdomain emotion- focused coping efficacy (p=0.04), and school absences (p=0.03). 50% of HI participants used self-hypnosis at least 3-4 times per week and tended to have greater QoL improvement than those who practiced less. Participants described improvement in stress, anxiety, and sleep, though corresponding measures were unchanged. 16-week outcomes and disease activity pending. Conclusion(s): Adolescents with CD have pain, reduced QoL, and psychological impairment despite inactive disease. Hypnosis is an acceptable, feasible, and promising complementary therapy in CD and may improve QoL, abdominal pain, coping efficacy, and school attendance. Additional RCTs with longer follow up, objective disease activity assessment, and measures to improve compliance are warranted.

N2  - Aim: To explore the lived experiences of patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD)to understand how the physical and psychological challenges associated with the disease influenced their life and what role did resilience play to cope up with the physical and psychological challenges. Method(s): The present study is qualitative in nature and used the phenomenological research design to study the lived experiences of CKD patients. Thirty seven participants were selected through purposive sampling from the nephrology departments of three government hospitals of Lahore which included Jinnah Hospital, Sheikh Zayed Hospital and General Hospital. Data was collected through in-depth interviews. Result(s): The study revealed that resilience is a major factor which helps to cope up with the physical and psychological challenges associated with CKD by reducing stress, developing a positive self-image, encouraging to fight back, finding alternative treatment options and increasing the will power of CKD patients. Practical implications: Findings of the present study will be helpful for the health care professionals and clinical psychologists to develop strategies and training programs which can increase resilience among patients. Training the patients and care givers regarding how to fight with CKD will lead to an improvement in their quality of life. Conclusion(s): Resilience enables CKD patients to have a self-worth and brings them back to life by motivating them to participate in the normal activities of life. On the basis of these results, it is expected that this factor can be helpful for the health care professionals, caregivers and patients themselves in order to minimize the negative impacts of the disease through counseling.Copyright © 2023 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: In emergency nursing situations, uncertainty may lead to delays, or block a decision which can have devastating consequences for a patient. The ambulance service is a complex clinical environment that often challenges the decision-making capabilities of the professionals, especially novice nurses. Novice nurses' uncertainty may also lead to unhealthy transitions and turnover. To increase the understanding of how uncertainty affects novice nurses, this study explores novice nurses' uncertainty during the first year of professional practice in the ambulance service. METHOD(S): A qualitative descriptive design was applied using qualitative content analysis of thirteen individual face-to-face semi-structured deep interviews. RESULT(S): From nine subcategories, three generic categories were derived: Reflections on contextual understanding, Strategies to create control, and Actions to take control. These were combined to form the main category Understanding what and dealing with how, while becoming a confident professional. CONCLUSION(S): Uncertainty is exacerbated by situations that demand rapid decisions or actions. This is especially true of newcomers to a profession. Preparing novices through study programs and encouraging continuous reflection in professional practice may increase resilience and tolerance of uncertainty, as well as benefiting professional development.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Mental health nursing work is challenging, and workplace stress can have negative impacts on nurses' well-being and practice. Resilience is a dynamic process of positive adaptation and recovery from adversity. The aims of this integrative review were to examine and update understandings and perspectives on resilience in mental health nursing research, and to explore and synthesize the state of empirical knowledge on mental health nurse resilience. This is an update of evidence from a previous review published in 2019. Using integrative review methodology, 15 articles were identified from a systematic search (July 2018-June 2022). Data were extracted, analysed with constant comparison method, synthesized narratively and then compared with the findings from the original review. As an update of evidence, mental health nurse resilience was moderate to high across studies, was positively associated with psychological well-being, post-traumatic growth, compassion satisfaction and negatively associated with burnout, mental distress and emotional labour. Lack of support and resources from organizations could negatively impact nurses' ability to maintain resilience and manage workplace challenges through internal self-regulatory processes. A resilience programme improved mental health nurses' awareness of personal resilience levels, self-confidence, capacity to develop coping skills and professional relationships. Some studies continue to lack contemporary conceptualizations of resilience, and methodological quality varied from high to low. Further qualitative and interventional research is needed to investigate the role of resilience in mental health nursing practice, personal well-being, workforce sustainability and the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Introduction There are few empirically supported social and emotional well-being programmes for First Nations adolescents, and we found none targeting those living in Aboriginal communities in remote areas of Australia. The dearth of social and emotional well-being programmes is concerning given that adolescents in remote Australia are at much greater risk of mental disorder and suicide. Our pragmatic community-based research intervention Enabling Dads and Improving First Nations Adolescent Mental Health' is designed by and for First Nations people living in remote communities to promote and support the parenting role and examine the interconnection between men's parenting knowledge and adolescent mental health. The aim is to improve adolescent mental health by strengthening the participating father's empowerment, parenting confidence and engagement in the parenting role. The words Aboriginal, First Nation and Indigenous are applied interchangeably, as appropriate, throughout the article. Methods and analysis The intervention is currently being conducted in five remote First Nations communities in Far North Queensland, Australia. The project is funded by the Medical Research Future (MRFF UNSW RG200484), and staff recruitment and training began in early December 2020. The aim is to recruit 100 men and dyad adolescents, that is, in each of the five community sites, we will recruit 20 men and adolescent dyads at baseline. To date, we have complete data collection in one community, and fieldwork will begin in the final community in September 2023. The intervention involves a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, using a novel and culturally designed and manualised parenting programme with men (Strong Fathers, SF). The comparison group is receiving a culturally congruent and familiar yarning/relaxation (YR) condition. The SF component focuses on reinforcing knowledge related to parenting adolescents, promoting father's empowerment, and increasing their confidence and engagement with the adolescent. The second component systematically measures and examines differences in adolescent social and emotional well-being before and after their father's involvement in either the SF or YR. The adolescent is blind to the father's group allocation. The outcome measures for the men include parenting knowledge, attitudes and beliefs; a First Nations measure for empowerment; the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (Indigenous) used to assess post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms; and alcohol use. The adolescent mental health outcomes are measured by a culturally congruent social and emotional well-being measure. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was granted from the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of Australia: Human Research Ethics Committee (1711/20). Results will be verbally shared at community meetings and conferences, and reports will be produced for community stakeholder use. Data will be available for community-controlled health services and stakeholders. Findings will also be published in peer-reviewed journals, and summaries will be provided to the funders of the study as well as male participants and adolescents.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

N2  - Objective To explore the mediating effect of expectations regarding aging between social support and frailty in elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), so as to promote better health education among medical staff and improve patients' ability to cope with frailty. Methods This was a cross-sectional study, the convenience sampling method was used to select 258 elderly COPD patients hospitalized in the Department of Respiratory Medicine and Geriatrics of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Hospital from November 2021 to April 2022. They were investigated by the general information questionnaire, Fried Scale, Social Support Scale and Expectations Regarding Aging-21. Analyzed the correlation among social support, expectations regarding aging and frailty. AMOS 26.0 was used to investigate the mediating effect of expectations regarding aging between social support and frailty in elderly COPD patients. Results The score of social support, expectations regarding aging and frailty in elderly patients with COPD was (30.45 +/- 5.57), (35.25 +/- 6.28) and (2.34 +/- 1.71)points, respectively. There was negative correlation between social support and frailty in elderly COPD patients (r=-0.541, P0.01), while positive correlation between social support and expectations regarding aging (r=0.477, P0.01). The negative correlation between social support and expectations regarding aging (r=-0.536, P0.01). Expectations regarding aging played a partial mediating role between social support and frailty, with mediating effect value of - 0.229, accounting for 35.39% of the total effect. Conclusions Expectations regarding aging is a mediator variable between social support and frailty in elderly COPD patients. Health care providers can alleviate or even reverse patients' debilitating condition by improving their expectations regarding aging and social support.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Background: Job burnout is among the most important determinants of employee productivity. Numerous factors affect the function of employees and burnout. Objective(s): Based on the available studies on healthcare providers, resilience and burnout are directly related to employee produc-tivity. This study aimed to investigate the effect of resilience training on job burnout in hospital staff. Method(s): Forty-six hospital staff were divided into case and control groups (23 in each group) and enrolled in the present pre-and post-intervention study. Each group completed the pre-test to assess resilience and burnout based on the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and Maslach Burnout Questionnaire (MBQ). The case group received six one-hour training sessions. During these sessions, some resilience and coping skills were provided. At the end of the sessions, the participants in both groups completed the resilience and burnout questionnaires. After one month, the staff filled in these questionnaires again, and the results of the questionnaires were compared before and after the intervention. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests using SPSS version 19 software. Result(s): The mean age of study participants was 38.47 and 36 years in the case and control groups, respectively, and demographic features were not significantly different between the study groups. The total score of the burnout scale decreased after the intervention in the case group and increased in the control group. In addition, after the intervention, the mean score of the total burnout scale was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group. All subscales in the case group significantly decreased after the intervention, while all subscales increased in the control group. This increase was significant in the emotional exhaustion subscale in the control group. Only emotional exhaustion after the intervention was significantly reduced in the case group. The resilience score in the case group increased significantly one month after the intervention. Conclusion(s): Resilience training as 6 one-hour training sessions significantly improved job burnout, and health officials can use this training method to improve the health and function of employees.Copyright © 2023, Author(s).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) pose a heavy burden on patients' lives and the health care system. The symptoms of PNES are often debilitating and cause high rates of disability and poor quality of life. Many treatment options are available, but there is no clear consensus on best practices. AIM: To critique and synthesize the current literature on nonpharmacologic interventions and effects on seizure frequency in patients with PNES. METHOD(S): An integrative review guided by the Whittemore and Knafl approach. RESULT(S): The review included 24 studies published from 2010 to 2020. Interventions for PNES included individualized psychotherapies, group therapies, multimodal psychotherapies, self-help therapies, and complementary and alternative medicine therapies. Individual psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and psychoeducation were the most used treatment modalities. The most effective treatments for seizure frequency reduction were those that included multiple psychotherapy sessions with a health care provider and covered multiple domains (e.g., understanding of diagnosis, identifying triggers, and developing effective coping strategies). CONCLUSION(S): Seizure frequency can be reduced in patients with PNES with multiple nonpharmacologic interventions. However, seizure frequency is not considered a comprehensive outcome measure and provides little insight into other important life domains. Further research is needed on nonpharmacologic interventions for PNES and effects on other areas of life such as sleep, employment status, global functioning, and self-efficacy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To offer support for patients who decide to discontinue antipsychotic and antidepressant medication, identifying which potentially modifiable factors correlate with discontinuation success is crucial. Here, we analyzed the predictive value of the professional support received, circumstances prior to discontinuation, a strategy of discontinuation, and use of functional and non-functional coping strategies during discontinuation on self-reported discontinuation success and on objective discontinuation. METHOD(S): Patients who had attempted discontinuing antipsychotics (AP) and/or antidepressants (AD) during the past 5 years (n = 316) completed an online survey including questions on subjective and objective discontinuation success, sociodemographic, clinical and medication-related factors, and scales to assess the putative predictors. RESULT(S): A regression model with all significant predictors explained 20-30% of the variance in discontinuation success for AD and 30-40% for AP. After controlling for baseline sociodemographic, clinical and medication-related factors, the most consistent predictor of subjective discontinuation success was self-care behavior, in particular mindfulness, relaxation and making use of supportive relationships. Other predictors depended on the type of medication: For AD, good alliance with the prescribing physician predicted higher subjective success whereas gradual tapering per se was associated with lower subjective success and a lower chance of full discontinuation. In those tapering off AP, leaving time to adjust between dose reductions was associated with higher subjective success and fewer negative effects. CONCLUSION(S): The findings can inform evidence-based clinical guidelines and interventions aiming to support patients during discontinuation. Further studies powered to take interactions between variables into account are needed to improve the prediction of successful discontinuation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nurses tend to be vulnerable to burnout and compassion fatigue due to constant workplace stressors. There is a need to provide advocacy, education, programming, and resources in the areas of positive coping and self-care to reduce burnout symptoms and promote well-being. RISE is an 8-week psychoeducational group intervention for nurses with four themes: resilience, insight, self-compassion, and empowerment. AIMS: This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of RISE on mental well-being. METHOD(S): The sample included 75 registered nurses who work in a hospital-based setting. Outcomes included resilience, insight, self-compassion, empowerment, stress mind-set, perceived stress, and burnout. Independent-samples t tests were conducted to compare outcomes between intervention and wait-list control groups at baseline and 1-month follow-up, as well as at 3-month follow-up. Supplemental analyses included paired-samples t tests and linear mixed models to compare the outcomes of the intervention group participants at baseline to 1-month follow-up, as well as at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. RESULT(S): Participants in the intervention group showed improved levels of insight (i.e., engagement in self-reflection), perceived stress, and burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion) when compared with the control group and improved levels of resilience, self-compassion, stress mind-set, and perceived stress when compared with their baseline. CONCLUSION(S): This study informs how RISE affects nurse well-being and may be an effective intervention for reducing burnout and stress. This type of whole-person intervention can support nurses to improve their well-being and ability to cope amid the complex interplay of factors at the individual, unit, and organizational levels.

N2  - Rationale: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is quite common in hospitalized ICU patients. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of PTSD in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients surviving severe covid 19 infections. Patients and methods/materials and methods: This study was conducted on surviving COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in the intensive care unit of Monastir in 2020 and 2021 using a validated instrument: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 (PCL-5) (1) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)-for screening PTSD. Data were collected via a telephonic questionnaire. Result(s): During the study period, 256 patients were hospitalized and discharged alive. We identified 105 patients' telephone numbers (41%). The telephonic questionnaire was conducted in 64 patients and 41 patients were not available for contact. The characteristics of the patients participating in the study were as follows: the median age of the patients was 55 years [47-61]. We noted a masculine predominance with a sex ratio of 1.6. All patients were ventilated with a noninvasive support and had prone sessions. The median SAPS II score was 25.5. The median PCL-5 score was 13 points (IQR = [7-26]). Among the population, seven patients (10.9%) had a PCL-5 score above the cut-off point of 31, which allowed the provisional diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder. We noticed that 35 patients (54.7%) had concentration and memory disorders. Sleeping disorders were present in 24 patients (37.5%) and 25 patients reported symptoms of irritability (39.1%). Four patients (6.3%) consulted a psychiatrist and only one patient was treated with benzodiazepines. Conclusion(s): About ten percent of COVID-19 survivors had symptoms of PTSD. Active involvement of mental health professionals for psychosocial support and providing timely counseling is necessary to avoid the deleterious effects of the pandemic on mental health.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - BACKGROUND: A collaborative event was run with NHS Ayrshire and Arran, and Flippin' Pain TM, to tackle the messaging around pain for communities living in Ayrshire and Arran. Due to the success of this event, funding was secured to support a national approach with three online seminars, to be delivered by Flippin' Pain TM in partnership with NHS Scotland and the Government. AIMS: The events aimed to deliver the following outcomes: * Help the significant number of people (18.1% Scottish adult population live with persistent pain who suffer from the debilitating effects of persistent pain, by introducing them to an evidence- based understanding of pain. This learning can positively shift beliefs about pain and increase pain health literacy * Support people to better manage their pain and make informed choices about the health care they access, and help individuals with persistent pain to maintain and support an independent lifestyle. * Address the significant levels of psychological and social difficulty associated with persistent pain and the current global pandemic * Support patients to improve their understanding and expectations of pain treatments to reduce the negative impact on both primary and secondary care resources, through unnecessary and inappropriate investigations and treatments. * Support education and self-management strategies for those on lengthy waiting lists, and support best management in line with evidence-based medicine, informed decision making and shared decision making. METHOD(S): The seminars share information about understanding of pain that addresses some of the inaccurate information and beliefs which are unhelpful for those affected by chronic pain including empowering individuals to make more informed decisions about their own health care. The webinar covers key messages around pain and a panel discussion with health care professionals and those living with persistent pain. All participants were asked to complete an online survey prior to and following watching the live or recording webinars, evaluation of the webinar series looked across a number of outcomes. RESULT(S): 2268 people registered, 48% were people living with pain. 212 people living with chronic pain responded to the online survey. * 50% of that cohort were also waiting for an appointment or treatment with an NHS service. * 64% reported after watching the webinar they felt more hopeful about the future. * 71% planned to try and increase or seek advice regarding ways to increase the amount of physical activity they do bull; 77% would recommend the webinar to someone else living with chronic pain. * 60% feel more confident to discuss my pain management with a healthcare professional Qualitative information was also captured: "I could have used different approaches to help me cope rather than taking strong medication" "Since I have listened to the first one I have managed to take myself off my medication with the help of myGP. I felt as if someone was finally listening" CONCLUSION(S): The outcomes of this webinar series strengthen the requirement for access to early pain education for individuals and health care professionals. The ultimate aim would be to continue to drive activities to improve population understanding of pain as a longterm condition and promote self-management and enhance those people living with pain to thrive in our communities. Although this was a funded development to support public health messaging and pain understanding, 86% of health care professionals attending indicated that they felt more confident in discussing pain and resources to support pain management following the webinar series. This highlights the power of educating health care professionals in improving confidence in delivering pain education.

N2  - Background/aims: Specialized palliative care (SPC) plays an important role in providing patient-centered care and support to caregivers, besides intensifying/coordinating collaboration among different health care sectors. This study proposes a SPC intervention enriched with a dyadic psychological intervention for patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers delivered by telemedicine at home. The primary aim is to investigate the intervention effects on the patients' health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes include sleep, anxiety/depression, health system use, survival, dyadic coping patient-caregiver, and caregiver burden. Method(s): A randomized controlled trial will be conducted at the Dept. Oncology, Rigshospitalet-DK. Patients' inclusion criteria: >=18 years, solid organ cancer, no longer receives curative treatment, able to speak/ understand Danish, cognitively able to participate, >= 1 symptom/problem with score >= 3 at EORTC QLQ-C30. Patients will indicate closest informal caregiver (>=18 years), who will be invited to participate in the study. Sample size=174 patients. The intervention group will have the first SPC appointment within 5 days from randomization and regular video appointments according to the SPC team's assessment, as well as 2-5 dyadic psychological intervention sessions. Monthly multidisciplinary conferences composed by oncology team, SPC team, general practitioner, and district nurse will be organized to discuss the patient's therapeutic plan. The control group will continue receiving standard care. Recruitment period estimation=14 months. Assessments are planned at inclusion and after 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6 months. A pilot study supported by the Danish Cancer Society will be conducted in 2022-2023. Result(s): Results are expected in jan 2023 Conclusion(s): Video consultations and the cooperation/integration model can inspire a new thinking regarding the organization of the future of palliative care for patients with cancer and their closest relatives in Denmark and abroad.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Background/aims: An encounter between the hospital clown and a child or person starts with making contact, in which the other person can feel seen and heard. The clowns does this by taking in the room, probing who the other person is, how he or she feels at that moment, but also by observing the other people present and then adjusting his play accordingly. The specific skills of the hospital clown can be directly translated to the practice of providing care. The CliniClowns use play to get the other person moving, physically or mentally. The main key words in play are: making contact offer safety connecting. In these core values the CliniClowns and the healthcare professional find each other. Both act on the basis of contact. Its sole purpose is to provide distraction, fun and relaxation, often with anxiety and stress reduction as its effect. But also empowerment, feeling seen and heard and or being challenged are effects that can be achieved through play. Method(s): We work in this workshop with interactive exercises and game assignments to really experience the potential of your perceptive abilities. Result(s): In this workshop you become aware of (physical and emotional) information present in space even before people address each other with words. This information turns out to be reliable and useful in communication. Furthermore the participants learn about the purpose of play and games. Conclusion(s): Participants gain knowledge about the value and impact of play and arts (clowning) interventions in the palliative care. How play, distractions and real connection result in resilience, pain- and stress reduction and a higher emotional well-being. And: Experience the value of (communication) skills and methods that the healthcare clown uses to connect and align with the other. Learn and experience to connect with others through play and navigate emotions from fear to trust. Is able to apply these skills in one's own practice for the benefit of the client and the healthcare professional.

N2  - Background/aims: Burnout negatively impacts the wellbeing of healthcare workers and the quality of patient care. It is essential to develop reliable tools to promote resilience in this group. Evidence suggests that creative pursuits may reduce burnout among health care workers by providing an effective space to process emotions and experiences. This ongoing project aims to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an innovative, cross-disciplinary pilot program using facilitated poetry writing and discussion to mitigate burnout for health care providers in Palliative and Emergency Medicine. Method(s): A writing facilitator with experience across multiple disciplines and settings led a series of six virtual writing workshops. Participants were presented with a model poem, then encouraged to write and share their own poetry via discussion and posting to an interactive online platform. We collected data on recruitment, retention, satisfaction, intent to participate in future programming, and factors affecting participation. Result(s): Of the 19 participants consented (13 Palliative; 6 Emergency), 16 attended at least one session. Of those who participated in at least one workshop, the median attendance was three sessions. Participant satisfaction, likelihood to recommend, and likelihood to engage in similar programming were measured using a 5-point Likert scale. Most respondents reported being at least somewhat satisfied with individual sessions (39/42; 92.8%) and the program overall (8/9; 88.9%). The majority reported being at least somewhat likely to recommend the program (47/51; 92.2%) and engage in similar programming (38/51; 74.5%). Barriers included clinical duties, conflicting meetings, and competing time commitments. Conclusion(s): While participant retention was lower than expected, individuals who engaged with the programming reported overall satisfaction with the sessions and program as a whole, indicating feasibility and acceptability of this type of program.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented stress on healthcare professionals worldwide. Since resilience and mentalizing capacity play very important preventive roles when it comes to mental health, the main goal of this study was to determine whether the capacity for mentalizing and resilience could explain the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted in Serbia on a sample of 406 healthcare workers (141 doctors and 265 nurses) aged 19 to 65 (M = 40.11, SD = 9.41). The participants' mental health status was evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-DASS-42. The Reflective Functioning Questionnaire was used to evaluate the capacity for mentalizing. Resilience was assessed using the Brief Resilience Scale. The results of the correlation analysis showed that there were negative correlations between resilience and all three dimensions of mental health status: depression, anxiety, and stress. Hypermentalizing was negatively correlated with depression, anxiety, and stress, while hypomentalizing was positively correlated. Hierarchical linear regression analysis showed that both resilience and hypermentalizing were significant negative predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress, and that hypomentalizing was a significant positive predictor of depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, socioeconomic status was a significant negative predictor of depression, anxiety, and stress. Marital status, number of children, and work environment were not statistically significant predictors of any of the three dimensions of mental health status among the healthcare workers in this study. There is an urgent need to establish and implement strategies to foster resilience and enhance the capacity for mentalizing among healthcare workers in order to minimize the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

N2  - Introduction: The healthcare and well-being of the population depend on multiple factors and should adapt to societal changes. The opposite is also occurring; society has evolved concerning the individuals' approach to their care, which includes participation in decision-making processes. In this scenario, health promotion and prevention become crucial to provide an integrated perspective in the organization and management of the health systems.Health status and well-being depend on many aspects, determinants of health, which in turn may be modulated by individual behavior. Certain models and frameworks try to study the determinants of health and individual human behaviors, separately. However, the interrelation between these two aspects has not been examined in our population.Our main objective is to analyze whether personal aptitudes related to behaviors are independently associated with the incidence of morbidity. A secondary objective will enquire whether these personal aptitudes are independently associated with lower all-cause mortality, enhanced adoption of healthy lifestyles, higher quality of life, and lower utilization of health services during follow-up. Method(s): This protocol addresses the quantitative branch of a multicenter project (10 teams) for the creation of a cohort of at least 3,083 persons aged 35 to 74 years from 9 Autonomous Communities (AACC). The personal variables to evaluate are self-efficacy, activation, health literacy, resilience, locus of control, and personality traits. Socio-demographic covariates and social capital will be recorded. A physical examination, blood analysis, and cognitive evaluation will be carried out.Several sets of six Cox models (one for each independent variable) will analyze the incidence of morbidity (objective 1); all-cause mortality and the rest of the dependent variables (objective 2). The models will be adjusted for the indicated covariates, and random effects will estimate Potential heterogeneity between AACC. Discussion(s): The analysis of the association of certain behavioral patterns and determinants of health is essential and will contribute to improving health promotion and prevention strategies. The description of the individual elements and interrelated aspects that modulate the onset and persistence of diseases will allow the evaluation of their role as prognostic factors and contribute to the development of patient-tailored preventive measures and healthcare.Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04386135.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine posttraumatic growth and psychological resilience and understand the relationship between posttraumatic growth and psychological resilience in frontline nurses. METHOD(S): This study was conducted on 263 nurses working at the pandemic clinics of a hospital of a healthcare group in Istanbul and a public hospital in Bursa between June 20 and September 01, 2020. Data were collected online to avoid the risk of infection using the personal information form, the Connor-Davidson resilience scale and the posttraumatic growth inventory. FINDINGS: There is a significant relationship between posttraumatic growth and psychological resilience in frontline nurses. Nurses with a master's degree have higher psychological resilience than those with a bachelor's degree. Also, those who are reported that they receive organizational support from the nursing services management have higher psychological resilience and posttraumatic growth scores. Participants who worked for the hospital in Istanbul, those who stayed at hotels, and those who had no communication problems with the healthcare team had statistically significant higher posttraumatic scores and subscale scores than others. Also, those who do not think that they can protect themselves from the virus enough have lower posttraumatic growth than those who think so. CONCLUSION(S): Psychological resilience was positively correlated with posttraumatic growth and its subscales. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Future studies should follow up on frontline nurses to determine the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological resilience and posttraumatic growth.Copyright © 2022 NANDA International, Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was a clinical validation of the NANDA-I nursing diagnosis "Impaired Resilience (00210)" in people under fertility treatment and determination of the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of the defining characteristics. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2019 and June 2020. A total of 104 patients were recruited through fertility-related websites, and they answered an online questionnaire after giving informed consent. The Rasch model was used for statistical analysis. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee. FINDINGS: The "Impaired Resilience (00210)" had a prevalence of 15.4% in the sample, and seven defining characteristics confirmed as representative are "decreased interest in vocational activities," "depression," "impaired health status," "ineffective coping strategies," "low self-esteem," "renewed elevation of distress," and "social isolation." No item showed differential item functioning. "Renewed elevation of distress" and "low self-esteem" were the most sensitive defining characteristics and had the highest negative predictive value. "Shame" was the most specific one. CONCLUSION(S): The nursing diagnosis "Impaired Resilience (00210)" was validated, and results may improve its accuracy in people going through fertility treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: This paper contributes by raising knowledge regarding NANDA-I nursing diagnosis and enhancing the quality of nurses' critical judgment and clinical reasoning. A more effective assessment will allow early recognition of patients struggling with adversity during fertility treatment and enhance a nursing resilience approach in the reproductive field.Copyright © 2022 NANDA International, Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this umbrella review was to determine the most effective nursing interventions for the prevention and management of suicidal behavior. In order to do so, the review identifies interventions from the Nursing Interventions Classifications taxonomy with evidence to this end. METHOD(S): A systematic search was conducted for systematic reviews included in the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Joanna Briggs Institute databases between January 1, 2011 and May 1, 2020. FINDINGS: The review is made up of 21 systematic reviews. In order to carefully analyze the interventions described, these were coded into categories, grouping the interventions into those based on psychological therapy, interventions related to pharmacotherapy, interventions related to the professional relationship between health professional and patient, and interventions aimed at the general public. CONCLUSION(S): Nursing interventions for suicide risk management are prevalent in the scientific literature and are shown to be effective for patients with suicidal ideation or suicide attempts. Prevention and treatment of suicidal behavior require the provision of coping tools, behavioral interventions that directly address suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and support through therapeutic partnerships, among others. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: This paper synthesizes the most current evidence on the most effective Nursing Interventions Classifications interventions for the treatment and prevention of suicidal behavior. It provides nursing practitioners with a comprehensive review of the therapeutic interventions with the best evidence and is useful for the development of clinical guidelines and protocols, as well as for the development of health policies and plans.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - Associations between alcohol use and stressful military experiences among service members (SM) are well documented; however, little is known about these associations among military spouses, who are primarily women. Meanwhile, current reports underscore growing concern about binge and heavy drinking and AUD prevalence among women compared to men. Military spouses (97% women), report increases in hazardous alcohol use behavior (unrelated to their partners alcohol use). Despite hypotheses of low levels of family readiness and reactivity to stress, it remains uncertain which aspects of the military family experience play a key role in spouses' risk of alcohol problems. Spouses report significant stress managing responsibilities of family life in the absence or reintegration of their SM where competing demands from multiple roles can be detrimental to women's health such as higher stress/negative affect and risky health behavior. Consistent with several theoretical frameworks on alcohol consumption as motivated to reduce tension or alleviate negative affective experiences, spouses who experience multiple role strain may show increased or problematic alcohol use. We examined drinking behavior among National Guard service member female spouses (N = 250, Mage = 37) recruited as part of the Military Employment Sleep and Health Study (MESH). We hypothesized that the relationship between spouses' role strain (RS) and psychological distress (i.e., K6 scores) would longitudinally predict alcohol use over a 9-month interval. RS was assessed using negative parenting behavior, chaotic home environment, and difficulty managing household/family obligation items. Alcohol use quantity, frequency and heavy use was measured using the AUDIT-C. Results from the indirect effects tests support drinking-to- cope theories of alcohol use such that mothers' baseline psychological distress predicted more frequent drinking at 9-months when mediated by increased 9-month RS, beta = 0.009, SE = 0.004, 95% CI [0.005, 0.064]. However, SM spouses did not appear to be significantly increasing their quantity or frequency of hazardous consumption in relation to psychological distress and RS. The longitudinal associations highlight the utility for longer-term family support interventions and prevention/treatment programs for spouses.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Dog ownership has been associated with reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in civilian epidemiological samples. Associations between dog ownership and cardiometabolic disease were examined in the 2019-2020 wave of the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study. Dog and cat ownership data were obtained from 3078 Veterans and cross-tabulated with self-reported, professionally diagnosed, heart disease, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. In unadjusted tests, dog ownership was associated with lower rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol, while cat ownership was not. Relative to non-owners, dog owners were younger, were more likely to screen positive for posttraumatic stress disorder and/or major depressive disorder, and more active. Binary logistic regression models of associations between dog ownership and cardiometabolic disease were adjusted for age, sex, trauma load, mood disorder, substance abuse, nicotine abuse, and exercise. After adjustment, dog ownership was still associated with lower odds of hypertension and high cholesterol. Dog ownership also interacted with exercise to lower odds of heart disease and attenuated the effect of trauma load on hypertension. Conversely, age interacted with dog ownership such that odds of diabetes and stroke were higher in older Veterans who owned dogs.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - Importance: Disruptions in the hospital clinical workforce threaten quality and safety of care and retention of health professionals. It is important to understand which interventions would be well received by clinicians to address the factors associated with turnover. Objective(s): To determine well-being and turnover rates of physicians and nurses in hospital practice, and to identify actionable factors associated with adverse clinician outcomes, patient safety, and clinicians' preferences for interventions. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This was a cross-sectional multicenter survey study conducted in 2021 with 21050 physicians and nurses at 60 nationally distributed US Magnet hospitals. Respondents described their mental health and well-being, associations between modifiable work environment factors and physician and nurse burnout, mental health, hospital staff turnover, and patient safety. Data were analyzed from February 21, 2022, to March 28, 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinician outcomes (burnout, job dissatisfaction, intent to leave, turnover), well-being (depression, anxiety, work-life balance, health), patient safety, resources and work environment adequacy, and clinicians' preferences for interventions to improve their well-being. Result(s): The study sample comprised responses from 15738 nurses (mean [SD] age, 38.4 [11.7] years; 10887 (69%) women; 8404 [53%] White individuals) practicing in 60 hospitals, and 5312 physicians (mean [SD] age, 44.7 [12.0] years; 2362 [45%] men; 2768 [52%] White individuals) practicing in 53 of the same hospitals, with an average of 100 physicians and 262 nurses per hospital and an overall clinician response rate of 26%. High burnout was common among hospital physicians (32%) and nurses (47%). Nurse burnout was associated with higher turnover of both nurses and physicians. Many physicians (12%) and nurses (26%) rated their hospitals unfavorably on patient safety, reported having too few nurses (28% and 54%, respectively), reported having a poor work environment (20% and 34%, respectively), and lacked confidence in management (42% and 46%, respectively). Fewer than 10% of clinicians described their workplace as joyful. Both physicians and nurses rated management interventions to improve care delivery as more important to their mental health and well-being than interventions directed at improving clinicians' mental health. Improving nurse staffing was ranked highest among interventions (87% of nurses and 45% of physicians). Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional survey study of physicians and nurses practicing in US Magnet hospitals found that hospitals characterized as having too few nurses and unfavorable work environments had higher rates of clinician burnout, turnover, and unfavorable patient safety ratings. Clinicians wanted action by management to address insufficient nurse staffing, insufficient clinician control over workload, and poor work environments; they were less interested in wellness programs and resilience training.

N2  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to understand the experiences and perceptions of newly graduated nurses in relation to resilience by providing an interpretive synthesis of the existing qualitative literature on this topic. BACKGROUND: Resilience in newly graduated nurses has been associated with increased satisfaction and decreased turnover. As the experience of resilience is unique to each individual, qualitative studies are well suited to explore this concept, yet the existing data is heterogenous. DESIGN: A qualitative metasynthesis was conducted using a meta-ethnographic approach. METHOD(S): The search was performed using PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global for the English literature and NDSL, KCI, RISS, KISS and DBpia for the Korean literature. The JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research was used to assess the quality of studies. An a priori protocol was created and registered on the Open Science Framework (Randall & De Gagne, 2022). RESULT(S): The final review included seven articles published between 2008 and 2021. Three main themes were identified: (1) internal experience of resilience; (2) external sources of resilience; and (3) building resilience over time. Subthemes were also identified. CONCLUSION(S): This study indicates that resilience can be developed over time during the period of transition from student nurse to professional nurse and is impacted by personal and organizational influences. The promotion of resilience presents considerations and opportunities for health care leaders and administrators.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: This scoping review aimed to describe and map interventions targeting psychosocial adaptation in people with stroke. Method(s): A scoping review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and reported according to Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. We included original studies with interventions targeting psychosocial adaptation (concept) on people with stroke (population) in any setting (context). We searched five online electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials). We described interventions in terms of design characteristics, theoretical basis, details of interventions, and quantitative outcomes indicated in psychosocial adaptation. Result(s): Forty-three studies were identified. Five intervention categories were identified to describe the interventions targeting psychosocial adaptation. Quantitative outcomes indicated psychosocial adaptation in our review were grouped into four domains: global adaptation, psychological adaptation, social adaptation, and others. Conclusion(s): The mapping and description brought to light the large heterogeneity of interventions targeting psychosocial adaptation in people with stroke. Practice implications: Deepening understanding of psychosocial adaptation can help health professionals further develop effective interventions aiming at promoting psychosocial adaptation and reducing negative health sequelae, such as risk of reduced psychosomatic recovery post stroke.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Persistent genital arousal disorder/genitopelvic dysesthesia (PGAD/GPD) is characterized by persistent, unwanted physiological genital arousal (i.e., sensitivity, fullness, and/or swelling) in the absence of sexual excitement or desire which can persist for hours to days and causes significant impairment in psychosocial well-being (e.g., distress) and daily functioning. The etiology and course of PGAD/GPD is still relatively unknown and, unsurprisingly, there are not yet clear evidence-based treatment recommendations for those suffering from PGAD/GPD. We present the case of a 58-year-old woman with acquired persistent genital arousal disorder, which began in March 2020; she believed she developed PGAD/GPD due to a period of significant distress and anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic. After seeking medical diagnosis and treatment from multiple healthcare providers and trying a combination of pharmacological and medical treatment modalities, she presented for psychological treatment. An integrative therapy approach (3 assessment sessions, 11 treatment sessions), which included cognitive behavior therapy, distress tolerance and emotion regulation skills from dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness practice, was utilized. The patient reported improvements anecdotally (e.g., decreased impact on occupational and social functioning, greater self-compassion, less frequent and shorter duration of PGAD/GPD flare-ups, improved ability to cope with PGAD/GPD symptoms, and decreased need for sleeping medication) and on self-report measures (e.g., lower PGAD/GPD catastrophizing, lower anxiety and depression, and greater overall quality of life).We report the use of an integrative (i.e., psychoeducational, cognitive behavioral, dialectical behavioral, and mindfulness-based) intervention, which may be an effective psychological treatment for PGAD/GPD.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To develop a conceptual framework that explores the process of building family resilience among Chinese families with children diagnosed with leukaemia. BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of childhood leukaemia has a devastating effect on the family. Nonetheless, some families were able to positively respond to the crisis. The process through which Chinese families bounce back has received little attention. DESIGN: Grounded theory. METHOD(S): This study used purposive and theoretical sampling to select 16 parents who agreed to participate in semistructured interviews after children were diagnosed with leukaemia. Data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously. Data were analysed through a process of open, axial and selective coding. The COREQ checklist was followed for reporting. RESULT(S): A core category of 'finding family resilience in adversity' was generated. The core category was underpinned by a transition process between two fluid stages: (a) Disrupting the family system, informed by subcategories of negative emotional disturbances and challenges of the diagnosis and treatment journey; (b) Cultivating resilience in families, informed by subcategories of increasing positive attitudes; establishing new family routines; activating good support systems; and practising open family communication. CONCLUSION(S): The transition process from the disruption of the family system to the cultivation of family resilience is perceived as a complex family dynamic in response to childhood leukaemia. Our findings can form the basis for further research about resilience-based family interventions that promote family well-being during the early stages of a childhood leukaemia diagnosis. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is necessary for healthcare professionals to provide essential support for families to face the challenges of diagnosis and treatment to facilitate the successful transition to family resilience. By understanding the dynamic process of developing family resilience, healthcare professionals are able to focus on these families to provide holistic care that satisfies the specific demands of family members.Copyright © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - This study aimed to explore the mediating and moderating effects of resilience and perseverance on pilots' self-efficacy and capability of handling special situations. Using cluster sampling, 251 pilots' self-efficacy, special flight situation handling capability, resilience and perseverance were assessed using standardized scales. Pilots with high self-efficacy can improve their resilience to enhance their capability to handle special situations. An analysis was performed that included perseverance in the mediation model, and results showed that the influence of self-efficacy on special situation handling through resilience was moderated by perseverance. The relations between self-efficacy and special flight situation handling capability present a moderated mediation model. A pilot's capability of handling special situations, ensuring flight safety and combat capability may be enhanced by improving their self-efficacy, resilience, and perseverance.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 caused disruption to healthcare services globally, resulting in high numbers of hospital admissions and with those discharged often requiring ongoing support. Within the UK, post-discharge services typically developed organically and were shaped over time by local need, funding, and government guidance. Drawing on the Moments of Resilience framework, we explore the development of follow-up services for hospitalised patients by considering the links between resilience at different system levels over time. This study contributes to the resilient healthcare literature by providing empirical evidence of how diverse stakeholders developed and adapted services for patients following hospitalisation with COVID-19 and how action taken at one system level influenced another. METHOD(S): Qualitative research comprising comparative case studies based on interviews. Across three purposively selected case studies (two in England, one in Wales) a total of 33 semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinical staff, managers and commissioners who had been involved in developing and/or implementing post-hospitalisation follow-up services. The interviews were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed. Analysis was conducted with the aid of NVivo 12. RESULT(S): Case studies demonstrated three distinct examples of how healthcare organisations developed and adapted their post-discharge care provision for patients, post-hospitalisation with COVID-19. Initially, the moral distress of witnessing the impact of COVID-19 on patients who were being discharged coupled with local demand gave clinical staff the impetus to take action. Clinical staff and managers worked closely to plan and deliver organisations' responses. Funding availability and other contextual factors influenced situated and immediate responses and structural adaptations to the post-hospitalisation services. As the pandemic evolved, NHS England and the Welsh government provided funding and guidance for systemic adaptations to post-COVID assessment clinics. Over time, adaptations made at the situated, structural, and systemic levels influenced the resilience and sustainability of services. CONCLUSION(S): This paper addresses understudied, yet inherently important, aspects of resilience in healthcare by exploring when and where resilience occurs across the healthcare system and how action taken at one system level influenced another. Comparison across the case studies showed that organisations responded in similar and different ways and on varying timescales to a disruption and national level strategies.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Due to exposure to overwhelming work stressors, approximately half of emergency department (ED) physicians and nurses experience burnout, leading to lower productivity, lower quality of care, higher risk of medical errors, higher rates of absenteeism, and eventually turnover. Growing evidence suggests that the physical environment can be leveraged to support healthcare workers' well-being. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to identify (1) self-care behaviors that healthcare workers engage in to help them cope with job-related stress, (2) where they engage in those behaviors, (3) attributes of the built environment that may support coping behaviors. METHOD(S): A mixed-methods study was conducted in three EDs, using online questionnaires (n = 85) and interviews (n = 20). RESULT(S): Job-related stress was derived from interruptions, workload and inability to take breaks, insufficient workspace, lack of privacy, unpredictability of EDs, and security concerns. Talking with a colleague, getting something to eat or drink, listening to music, and taking a walk were considered destressing activities. The bathroom was considered a place for destressing by the majority of participants, followed by outside areas, physician-only areas, and care team stations. Supportive environmental features included sufficient workspace, maximized privacy, reduced noise and clutter, controlled temperature and lighting, spaces for decompressing, spaces for documentation, close-by breakrooms with enough eating space and massage chairs, chairs with back support, standing desks, food options, and convenient bathrooms. CONCLUSION(S): Design decisions play an important role in supporting stress reduction among healthcare workers. This study provides several strategies to achieve this aim.

N2  - Subjective tinnitus is a highly prevalent sound sensation produced in most cases by persistent neural activity in the auditory pathway of the patient. Audiologists should be confident that they can employ elements of sound therapy and related counseling to support patients in coping. However, patients with bothersome tinnitus may be challenged by mental health complications, and they struggle to find adequate care when tinnitus and psychological distress co-occur. Audiologists in many cases lack the confidence to provide in-depth counseling while mental health providers lack basic understanding of tinnitus, its mechanisms, and the elements of audiologic management that could support patients in coping. At the very least, audiologists should be able to explain the mechanisms involved in and contributing to negative tinnitus effects, conduct valid measures of these effects, and offer reasonable options for managing the consequences linked by the patient to bothersome tinnitus and sound-related sensations. This brief communication summarizes the current state of tinnitus-related opportunities offered in US audiology training programs, and the substantial need to improve both the education of practitioners and the delivery of services to patients in need.Copyright © 2023 by the author.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the global prevalence of low resilience among the general population and health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): Embase, Ovid-MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, WHO COVID-19 databases, and grey literature were searched for studies from January 1, 2020, to August 22, 2022. Hoy's assessment tool was used to assess for risk of bias. Meta-analysis and moderator analysis was performed using the Generalized Linear Mixed Model with a corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) adopting the random-effect model in R software. Between-study heterogeneity was measured using I2 and tau2 statistics. Result(s): Overall, 44 studies involving 51,119 participants were identified. The pooled prevalence of low resilience was 27.0 % (95 % CI: 21.0 %-33.0 %) with prevalence among the general population being 35.0 % (95 % CI: 28.0 %-42.0 %) followed by 23.0 % (95 % CI: 16.0 %-30.9 %) for health professionals. The 3-month trend analysis of the prevalence of low resilience beginning January 2020 to June 2021 revealed upward then downward patterns among overall populations. The prevalence of low resilience was higher in females, studied during the delta variant dominant period, frontline health professionals, and undergraduate degree education. Limitation(s): Study outcomes showed high heterogeneity; however, sub-group and meta-regression analyses were conducted to identify potential moderating factors. Conclusion(s): Globally, 1 out of 4 people among the general population and health professionals experienced low resilience due to COVID-19 adversity. The prevalence of low resilience was twice as much among the general population compared to health professionals. These findings provide information for policymakers and clinicians in the development and implementation of resilience-enhancing programs.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Background: Causes and consequences of chronic stress levels in the context of healthcare work are well examined. Nevertheless, the implementation and evaluation of high-quality interventions to reduce stress of healthcare workers is still missing. Internet and app-based interventions are a promising venue for providing interventions for stress reduction to a population that is otherwise difficult to reach due to shift work and time constraints in general. To do so, we developed the internet and app-based intervention (fitcor), a digital coaching of individual stress coping for health care workers. Method(s): We applied the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement as a guideline for the present protocol. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted. There are five different intervention groups and one waiting control group. To achieve the sample sizes required by power analysis (G*Power) (beta-error 80%; effect size 0.25), the sample sizes of the respective scenarios will be at best as follows: 336 care workers from hospitals, 192 administrative health personnel, 145 care workers from stationary elderly care homes, and 145 care workers from ambulatory care providers in Germany. Participants will randomly be assigned to one of five different intervention groups. A crossover design with a waiting control group is planned. Interventions will be accompanied by three measurement points, first a baseline measure, second a post-intervention measure directly after completion of the intervention, and a follow-up measure 6 weeks after completion of the intervention. At all three measurement points, perceived team conflict, work-related experience patterns, personality, satisfaction with internet-based training, and back pain will be assessed using questionnaires, as well as heart rate variability, sleep quality, and daily movement will be recorded using an advanced sensor. Discussion(s): Workers in the health care sector increasingly face high job demands and stress levels. Traditional health interventions fail to reach the respective population due to organizational constraints. Implementation of digital health interventions has been found to improve stress coping behavior; however, the evidence in health care settings has not been established. To the best of our knowledge, fitcor is the first internet and app-based intervention to reduce stress among nursing and administrative health care personnel. Trial registration: The trial was registered at DRKS.de on 12 July 2021, registration number: DRKS00024605.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - Context The NWLS consists of doctors and dentists at all stages of training. There are three reginal sub-committees: Greater Manchester, Cheshire & Merseyside and Lancashire & Cumbria. This submission is by members of the Greater Manchester sub-comittee. Each sub-committee aims to arrange two virtual events each during the year. The three sub-committees collaborate to create a full-day leadership event. Issue/Challenge We are aware of the varying opportunities for leadership development in different training posts. Our committee aims to support leadership development of trainee doctors and dentists within the North West by organising a series of events throughout the year. The Greater Manchester Committee have organised two virtual events and all three committees arranged a face-to-face event in July. The events aim to promote leadership amongst trainees and act as a platform for local leaders to showcase their work. Assessment of issue and analysis of its causes All trainees in the North West were informed of the events in advance, by email from Health Education England. Interested candidates could register via an email link. Impact Feedback from each event was collected. Feedback from the face-to-face, full day event had 60 responses. 84% rated the workshops as 'very good' or excellent'. 75% of delegates attended for the advertised content and speakers. 50% attended as they saw it as a network opportunity. Feedback from the virtual event 'Under Pressure' in January had 62 responses. 100% of attendees reported that the event helped to fulfil leadership requirements. Candidates reported feeling more confident (37% strongly agree, 63% somewhat agree) in their leadership approach and 76% felt they would like to start a leadership project following the event. Feedback from the virtual event 'Local Leaders' in March had 62 respondents. 97% of attendees reported that the event helped to fulfil leadership requirements. 90% of candidates reported feeling more confident (34% strongly agree, 56% somewhat agree) in their leadership approach and 87% felt they would like to start a leadership project following the event. Intervention Our events have helped candidates to become more confident in their own leadership approach and have encouraged them to start their own leadership projects. The events have also been a great opportunity for networking. These leadership opportunities could be reproduced in other regions or even at a National Level. Involvement of stakeholders, such as patients, carers or family members: Patients were not directly involved in the events held but are expected to benefit from improved leadership and management skills amongst the medical profession. We did however include a range of emergency service professionals such as paramedics and firefighters so that we could reflect on our similarities and differences between the professions when coping under pressure. Key Messages The NWLS events are helping to promote leadership opportunities, and are encouraging trainees to start their own leadership journeys. We propose that our model can be utilised in other Deaneries within the UK, in order to promote excellence in leadership education. Lessons learnt We are hoping to recruit new members to the committee each year to replace existing members leaving but also to bring new ideas to the table. Going forward, we feel a mix of virtual and face to face events work well. We may however try to give more notice of events so even more candidates can attend. Measurement of improvement Feedback from the events were collected by emailing a link to an evaluation form to attendees. Feedback was anonymised. Strategy for improvement To continue promoting leadership development of trainees in the North West, the NWLS will continue to host events in the region in the coming year.

N2  - Background: Healthcare workers are leading the way in treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to the high levels of psychological stress, this group is more likely to experience psychological issues. These psychological problems in healthcare providers include depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to find out how common these problems were in the face of COVID-19. Method(s): On 20 February 2022, systematic searches were conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, EMBASE, Science Direct, Web of Science and ProQuest databases. Two authors selected articles based on search keywords. As a last step, articles about the prevalence of psychological problems among healthcare workers in the face of COVID-19 were looked at and analysed for five different outcomes. Result(s): The initial search yielded 18,609 articles. After reviewing the titles, abstracts and full texts of the articles, 44 were chosen for the final analysis and 29 were subjected to a meta-analysis. Insomnia, anxiety, depression, PTSD and stress are among the psychological issues faced by healthcare workers. Furthermore, the highest pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD and stress was 36% (95% confidence interval (CI) 24-50%), 47% (95% CI 22-74%), 49% (95% CI 28-70%), 37% (95% CI 19-59%) and 27% (95% CI 6-69%). Conclusion(s): In this meta-analysis, insomnia was found to be the most common mental health problem, followed by anxiety, PTSD, depression and stress in healthcare workers in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, the pooled prevalence of these mental health problems was higher among physicians, nurses and older staff in the subgroup analysis. As a result, health policymakers and managers of the health care system should think about effective interventions to promote mental health, paying particular attention to these two groups.Key points Studies conducted in China reported more mental problems than in other countries. Health policymakers and health system managers should hold training programs to promote healthcare workers' mental health with a particular focus on more vulnerable groups. The prevalence of PTSD, stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia were higher among physicians, nurses and older staff. Health systems at both national and local levels have to take older physicians, nurses and healthcare providers into consideration while designing interventions.Copyright © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Health professionals' maldistribution and retention in underserved areas are global problems. Burnout drives health professionals to leave rural areas. Chronic burnout is linked to depression, and nurses have a higher risk for depression than the general population. Studies suggest that increasing resilience may reduce depression. However, little is known about the effect of resilience on nurses' depression and their rural retention. This study aims to understand the impact of resilience and depression on nurses' retention in rural areas. METHOD(S): An online cross-sectional survey on registered nurses was conducted in July - August 2021 in a rural province in Indonesia. The survey measured the nurses' resilience, depression level, and work duration. RESULT(S): A total of 1050 participants joined the study. The results suggest that resilience in nurses is negatively correlated to depression and retention. The mildly depressed group had the shortest retention. There was no difference in the work duration, depression, and resilience scores between the underserved and non-underserved regencies in the province. DISCUSSION: Although not all our hypotheses are supported, some interesting results were obtained. In a previous study, the more senior the doctor, the higher the resilience; in this nurse analysis, the opposite was true - senior nurses were the least resilient. As found in other studies, resilience is negatively correlated to depression. So, resilience training may still benefit the depressed group. CONCLUSION(S): Improvement of health professionals' rural retention requires approaches tailored to each profession. Resilience training may be beneficial to retain nurses through mild depression treatment.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Qualitative insights may demonstrate how combat medics (CM) deal with stressors and identify how resilience can potentially develop. Yet, qualitative research is scant in comparison to the many quantitative studies of health outcomes associated with military service., METHOD: Semistructured qualitative interviews were used to collect personal narratives of US Army CMs who had previously served in Iraq or Afghanistan., RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed three key driving forces for how resilience develops in the context of combat and war. The first was patriotism, which captures loyalty and full commitment to the military and its missions. The second was commitment to their family, reflecting the balance of responsibility to family of origin with the obligation one feels towards their military family. The last driving force was faith, or the drive to reach towards the transcendent to provide a moral compass and develop empathy in the face of difficult situations., CONCLUSIONS: An individual's commitment to country, military family and faith strengthens their resilience, and this can be used to inform future research efforts as well as current clinical practice.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

N2  - Objectives: Physicians and the medical/scientific establishment during Nazism and the Holocaust committed egregious ethical violations including complicity with genocide. Critical reflection on this history serves as a powerful platform for scaffolding morally resilient professional identity formation (PIF) with striking relevance for contemporary health professions education and practice. Study aim was to explore the impact of an Auschwitz Memorial study trip within the context of a medicine during Nazism and the Holocaust curriculum on students' personal and PIF. Method(s): The authors analyzed 44 medical and psychology students' reflective writings from a 2019 Auschwitz Memorial study trip using immersion-crystallization qualitative thematic analysis. Result(s): Six distinct themes and 22 subthemes were identified and mapped to a reflective learning process model: 1. "What am I bringing?"2. "What am I experiencing through the curriculum?"3. "What am I initially becoming aware of as a first response?"4./5. "How and what am I processing?"6. "What am I taking with me?" Particularly compelling subthemes of power of the place, emotional experience, reflection on myself as a moral person, and contemporary relevance referred to impactful course elements. Conclusion(s): This curriculum catalyzed a critically reflective learning/meaning-making process supporting personal and PIF including critical consciousness, ethical awareness, and professional values. Formative curriculum elements include narrative, supporting emotional aspects of learning, and guided reflection on moral implications. The authors propose Medicine during Nazism and the Holocaust curriculum as a fundamental health professions education component cultivating attitudes, values, and behaviors for empathic, moral leadership within inevitable healthcare challenges.Copyright © 2023 Riesen et al.

N2  - Background: Although observational studies have already shown promising results of flourishing, a broader concept of health based on positive psychology, there is still a gap in the literature regarding studies that combine different topics of flourishing in a single intervention. Objective(s): To develop a comprehensive and integrate intervention based on positive psychology gathering different topics of flourishing to improve mental health outcomes in individuals with depressive symptoms. Method(s): The following steps were performed: (1) a comprehensive literature review; (2) the designing of a 12-session group intervention based on the values, virtues, and topics of flourishing; (3) assessment of the rationale, coherence, and feasibility by a panel of healthcare professionals answering semi-structured questions, and (4) application of an e-Delphi technique including mental health experts to reach a consensus of at least 80% for each item of the protocol. Result(s): A total of 25 experts participated in the study, 8 in the panel with semi-structured questions and 17 in the e-Delphi technique. A three-round e-Delphi technique was required to reach a consensus for all items. In the first round, a consensus was reached for 86.2% of the items. The remaining items (13.8%) were either excluded or reformulated. In the second round, a consensus was not obtained on one item, which was reformulated and approved in the third round. Qualitative analyses of the open questions were performed and suggestions for the protocol were considered. The final version of the intervention was composed of 12 weekly group sessions with 90-min each. The topics included in the intervention were physical and mental health, virtues and character strengths, love, gratitude, kindness, volunteering, happiness, social support, family, friends and community, forgiveness, compassion, resilience, spirituality, purpose and meaning of life, imagining the "best possible future," and flourishing. Conclusion(s): The flourishing intervention was successfully developed using an e-Delphi technique. The intervention is ready to be tested in an experimental study to verify its feasibility and effectiveness.Copyright © 2023 Goncalves, Braghetta, Alvarenga, Gorenstein, Lucchetti and Vallada.

N2  - Rising suicide rate is a global concern. Although suicide is considered deeply personal and an individual act, suicidal behaviour is determined by a number of biological, psychological and social factors. Despite the burgeoning research on risk factors of suicide, information on suicide prevention and protective factors is limited. Suicide is a multifaceted problem and hence suicide prevention programs should also be multipronged. Collaboration, coordination, cooperation and commitment are needed to develop and implement a suicide prevention program, which is cost-effective, available, accessible, appropriate and relevant to the needs of the individuals and community. In india, suicide is seen more from a social and public health perspective in line with this year world suicide prevention days theme-connect, communicate and care, the time is ripe for mental health professionals to accept and adopt proactive role in suicide prevention. Several promising empirically based suicide prevention strategies have been identified, including school-based skills training for students, screening for at-risk population, health professional education, gate keeper training, media education and guidelines for reporting suicide, mental health literacy, lethal-means restriction, enhancing resilience, connectedness and stress management skills etc. In this symposium, we will highlight current face of suicide prevention services in india, available support, experiential learning from professionals running suicide prevention clinics and programs and wiser words by senior psychiatrist about how to fill these gaps in existing services, implementation of multidisciplinary team approach and working together for this humane cause.

T1  - Yoga and the Need of Its Integration in Modern Medicine
A1  - Santra G. 
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Growing evidences of the health benefits of yoga are available in the literature. But physicians are not aware of it. METHODOLOGY: Databases like PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, and Scopus are searched for the articles on preventive, therapeutic, and rehabilitation potential of yoga. Scientific evidences available are analyzed and incorporated into the article. RESULT(S): Yoga provides relief from stress, anxiety, depression, and obsessive thoughts. It promotes better sleep. It relieves psychosomatic disorders. Yoga helps to cope with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Pranayama appears to alter autonomic responses by breath-holding that increases vagal tone and decreases sympathetic discharge and causes relaxation. Yoga increases GABAergic activity that has an anxiolytic effect. Yoga reduces stress-induced cortisol release and reduces hyperglycemia. Yoga reduces seizure frequencies, prevents rapid cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, and helps in poststroke rehabilitation. Reduction of blood pressure and heart rate are seen with yoga. Yoga increases heart rate variability (HRV) and reduces health consequences of allostatic overload. Pranayama improves the vital capacity of lungs. Yoga improves musculoskeletal flexibility and enhances the ability of sustained isometric muscle contraction. Yoga is proved to be a viable adjunct of drug therapy for depression and anxiety. It is a promising alternative to psychoanalysis and cognitive behavior therapy. Yoga prevents lifestyle disorders. CONCLUSION(S): Yoga is safe and affordable. Integration of yoga in modern medicine needs intensification because of its various health-promoting, disease-preventing, therapeutic, and rehabilitative effects.Copyright © Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.

N2  - Introduction: Needle procedures are a cause of pain and distress for children in the emergency department (ED). Combined strategies such as preparation, comfort positions, distraction/relaxation techniques and topical anesthetic can help children cope with various painful and stressful procedures. A trained professional such as a Certified Child Life Specialist (CCLS) can facilitate the uptake of these strategies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of strategies to reduce procedural pain and distress for children in the pediatric ED of a tertiary care pediatric hospital with the implementation of an institutional quality improvement (QI) initiative that worked closely with a CCLS. Method(s): An ongoing hospital-wide QI initiative, called Tout doux, aims to alleviate procedural pain and distress. To evaluate the impact of the QI initiative on the use of pain and distress strategies for patients with a needle procedure, we prospectively recorded CCLS interventions in the pediatric ED over a one-year period. More specifically, the number of strategies used for each patient undergoing a needle procedure was reported to track progress throughout the integration of the Tout doux QI project. Result(s): Between Sept 2021 and Aug 2022, the CCLS was present for 397 needle procedures (Mean age: 6 yo [0 months-17yo]), including IV-line insertions (56%), venous blood draws (30%) and capillary blood tests (14%). Parents were present in 99% procedures. Preparation strategies by the CCLS were possible for 65% of the procedures. Distraction was used for 98% of the procedures, using either active (eg. interactive games [56%]) or passive distraction (eg. video [31%], music [20%]). Deep breathing was used in 46% of procedures. A topical anesthetic was proposed to 70% of children. The proportion of children receiving at least 3 strategies alleviating procedural pain and distress increased to more than 90% during the last 7 months (except for 1 exceptionally busy month) in comparison to 22%-66% for the first 5 months, with the implementation of the Tout doux initiative. Conclusion(s): A QI project aiming to improve the management of procedural pain and distress in an institution increased the use of combined coping strategies for children in the pediatric ED. This QI initiative sensibilized the health care providers to the importance of the combined use of strategies, promoted by the presence of the CCLS. Further studies will need to evaluate their impact on patients and the sustainability of their use.

N2  - Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, data emerged on the increased risk for psychological distress on healthcare staff. Work volume, personal safety, patient illness acuity, and high mortality rate contributed to distress on healthcare providers. The organizational leadership at M.D. Anderson Children's Cancer Hospital responded to a concern for the psychological safety of their healthcare workforce by encouragingwellness programming. Agrassrootswellness taskforce was assembled within the pediatric department at the institution with a principal aim of promoting community, resilience, and wellness. Eventually, the primary goal evolved into the creation of an effective virtual wellness program. Objective(s):Our aim is to present the results of a 26-month long quality improvement initiative involving the establishment of a Weekly Wellness virtual program aimed to decrease psychological stress among staff members at M.D. Anderson Children's Cancer Hospital. Design/Method: We launched a virtual program, Weekly Wellness for all healthcare staff which was based on the Stanford Model for Professional Fulfillment and guided by the quality improvement Plan- Do-Study-Act (PDSA) framework. Weekly Wellness was a 50-minute live-streamed program with varied thematic content promoting health and wellbeing, workplace efficiency, and community. The program was evaluated and modified based on data collected from confidential electronic surveys sent to the staff. Three PDSA cycles were completed. Result(s): Ninety-seven Weekly Wellness program sessions and 3 staff surveys were conducted between March 2020 and May 2022. Of 300 total staff, 125 (41.6%) completed at least one survey and of these, 114 attended at least one wellness program (91.2%). Most participants (83-98%) found the program helpful and 69.4% (90% confidence interval of 69.0-79.4) experienced decreased distress. After attending the program, the mean decrease in distress was 1.67 (standard deviation of 2.2) on a 10-point scale. Lifted spirits and increased social connectivity were the most frequently reported benefits. Conclusion(s): This virtual wellness program was favorably received by pediatric oncology healthcare staff. Participants of the program endorsed increased social connectivity and improved mood during a period of pandemic-related social isolation guidelines. This program was implemented by an interdisciplinary pediatric collaboration and sustained through the present day.

N2  - Background and aim of the work: The Covid-19 pandemic led to an increased demand for healthcare professionals, particularly nurses. The Piacenza Local Health Service, Northern Italy, issued several calls for tenders in order to recruit nurses and the University anticipated graduation sessions, so several new graduates nurses found themselves facing their first work experience in the middle of the pandemic emergency. It is well known that being a first-time employee causes stress, but there are few studies yet investigating the perception of newly employed nurses during the pandemic. The aim of this research is therefore to describe the experience of these nurses. Method(s): A descriptive qualitative study was conducted through interviews. The research was approved by the 'Area Vasta Emilia Nord Ethics Committee. Result(s): 14 nurses were interviewed and nine themes were found. Emotions, awareness, job opportunities, professional liability, organisational aspects and relationship with the other. Conclusion(s): Our study shows how stress, anxiety and feelings of inadequacy characterise new nurses' entry into the workplace. Emotional support strategies, such as counselling and emergency preparedness training, could help early career professionals to cope with complex and emotion-ally charged clinical care situations with greater resilience.

N2  - This randomized controlled trial examined the impact of a psychoeducational group program on the mental well-being of unit-based nurse leaders, specifically nurse managers and assistant nurse managers. The program was developed around the themes of resilience, insight, self-compassion, and empowerment to fight burnout and enhance purposeful adaptive coping to reduce distress and improve mental wellbeing. The sample included 77 unit-based nurse leaders. Outcomes included post-traumatic growth, resilience, insight, self-compassion, empowerment, perceived stress, burnout, and job satisfaction. Paired samples t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA tests were conducted to compare outcomes at baseline to the follow-up timepoints of endpoint, one-month follow-up, three-month follow-up, and six-month follow-up. The intervention group participants showed significant improvement in post-traumatic growth between baseline and all follow-up timepoints compared to the waitlist control group. Among intervention group participants, there were also significant improvements in self-reflection and insight, self-compassion, psychological empowerment, and compassion satisfaction, as well as significant reductions in perceived stress, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress. This study extends existing evidence that this psychoeducational group program can be an effective intervention for improving and protecting mental wellbeing. Among nurse leaders, it can reduce stress and burnout and improve post-traumatic growth, self-reflection and insight, self-compassion, psychological empowerment, and compassion satisfaction.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

N2  - Social workers involved in interdisciplinary orthopedic trauma care can benefit from the knowledge of providers' perspectives on healthcare disparities in this field. Using qualitative data from focus groups conducted on 79 orthopedic care providers at three Level 1 trauma centers, we assessed their perspectives on orthopedic trauma healthcare disparities and discussed potential solutions. Focus groups originally aimed to detect barriers and facilitators of the implementation of a trial of a live video mind-body intervention to aid in recovery in orthopedic trauma care settings (Toolkit for Optimal Recovery-TOR). We used the Socio-Ecological Model to analyze an emerging code of "health disparities" during data analysis to determine at which levels of care these disparities occurred. We identified factors related to health disparities in orthopedic trauma care and outcomes at the Individual (Education- comprehension, health-literacy; Language Barriers; Psychological Health- emotional distress, alcohol/drug use, learned helplessness; Physical Health- obesity, smoking; and Access to Technology), Relationship (Social Support Network), Community (Transportation and Employment Security), and Societal level (Access- safe/clean housing, insurance, mental health resources; Culture). We discuss the implications of the findings and provide recommendations to address these issues, with a specific focus on their relevance to the field of social work in health care.

N2  - Elevated psychological stress can lead to moral distress affecting health care workers and organizations affecting patient care, job satisfaction, and retention. A Moral Resilience Collaborative program was implemented through an academic partnership between a school of nursing and a rehabilitation facility to provide the health care workers in the facility the skills necessary for self-management of moral distress and move them toward moral resilience. Moral distress and resiliency were measured pre-implementation using the Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) and Short Resiliency Survey (SRS), respectively. Unfortunately, postsurvey quantitative data collection failed due to COVID-19 surges though qualitative data obtained during debriefing sessions demonstrated effectiveness of the project. Based on debriefing comments and the preimplementation MMD-HP mean score and SRS decompression score, the staff in this facility experienced similar types of moral distress as those working in acute care or critical care settings. Even when resiliency programs are needed the most and readily available, patient care demands, a busy work environment, and external factors can hinder staff participation in such endeavors.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Background: Research has shown that eczema patients prefer some degree of shared control over treatment decisions, but little is known about factors perceived to be important to facilitate shared decision making (SDM). Objective(s): To determine factors eczema patients and caregivers consider to be important for SDM, and how often they experience them with their eczema healthcare provider (HCP). Method(s): A cross-sectional survey study (64 questions) was conducted, which included factors related to SDM rated by respondents on a Likert scale for importance, and how often these factors were true with their current eczema HCP. Result(s): Respondents (840, response rate 62.4%) most frequently rated their health literacy and communication skills as important for SDM. Factors which indicated a strong provider-patient relationship, and HCPs who initiate treatment conversations were also deemed beneficial. Low importance was placed on concordant HCP race/ethnicity, however, of those who did rate it as important, 53/91 identified as Black (half of all Black respondents). Limitation(s): A high proportion of respondents were aware of the term SDM prior to the survey. Conclusion(s): SDM is more likely to be facilitated when patient education and empowerment are coupled with HCPs who initiate treatment discussions, maintain compassion resilience, and listen to patient perspectives.Copyright © 2023 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

N2  - Objective: Participation in qualitative research, particularly analysis of recorded medical dialogue, offers real-time, longitudinal immersion that can strengthen clinical trainee communication skills. The study objective was to explore how qualitative research participation impacts clinical trainees' self-perceived communication skills development and practice. Method(s): In this study, a 17-member multidisciplinary working group of child life specialists, advanced practice providers, undergraduate/medical students, residents, fellows, attending physicians, social scientists, and career researchers with recent qualitative and communication research experience assembled to discuss this topic using a structured discussion guide. Content analysis was used to identify concepts and themes. Result(s): Three key themes characterizing the impact of qualitative research participation on aspiring clinicians' communication skills development and practice arose - the 3Cs: (1) Connection, therapeutic alliance, and accompaniment; (2) Clarity and prognostic communication; (3) Compassion, empathy, and understanding. Participants emphasized that qualitative research learning improved their understanding of patient/family lived experiences, preparing them for future clinical encounters, strengthening their emotional intelligence, and promoting self-care, resilience, and professional affirmation. Conclusion(s): Immersion in clinical communication through participation in qualitative research is an under-utilized resource for supporting clinical trainees in communication skills development. Innovation: The process of collaborative knowledge production through the collective exploration of an a priori question related to group members' collective experiences is methodologically innovative. Further, re-thinking qualitative research participation as an underutilized educational opportunity is pedagogically novel, and leaders in medical education and qualitative research should collaborate to realize the potential of this teaching tool.Copyright © 2022 The Authors

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was a pilot examination to identify and assess relationships among social vulnerability, personal resilience, and preparedness for a sample of US residents living in the Gulf South, who had experienced climate-related disaster (e.g., hurricanes) and the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): Binary logistic regression was conducted using primary survey data collected in 2020 (n = 744) to identify statistically significant explanatory variables of sociodemographic characteristics and resilience, measured by the CD-RISC 10, of climate-related disaster, and pandemic preparedness. RESULT(S): Results indicate that respondents who identified as white, had more education, were in a relationship, and spoke English as a first language, as well as respondents who had exhibited greater resilience, were more likely to prepare for a climate-related disaster. Respondents who spoke English as a first language, had more education, and greater resilience were found to be statistically significant explanatory variables of pandemic preparedness. Respondents who prepared for disaster were also more likely to prepare for the pandemic. CONCLUSION(S): These findings provide insights into protective factors related to preparedness, including linkages between resilience and preparedness that can aid public health professionals in supporting resilience and preparedness efforts for impacted communities.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to understand and identify barriers to resilience in young and middle-aged patients with lymphoma in the context of Chinese culture. METHOD(S): A qualitative descriptive study was employed. Face-to-face, semi-structured, and in-depth individual interviews were conducted between May and July 2022. Purposive and differential sampling was used to select eligible participants. Conventional content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data and identify categories and subcategories. This study followed the COREQ checklist. RESULT(S): Twenty patients aged 28-59 years completed the interviews. Three categories involving thirteen subcategories were identified from the interview data: (1) internal barriers-derived from individual cognitive, emotional, behavioral, spiritual, and physical distress, resulting in internal negative constructs, and reducing the motivation to overcome adversity; (2) unbalanced family functioning-families threatened by disease are incapable of maintaining normal functioning and fail to act effectively when facing crises; and (3) absent social support-insufficient or unavailable shielding protection from social support further inhibits resilience among patients with lymphoma. CONCLUSION(S): This study identified various barriers to the resilience of young and middle-aged patients with lymphoma in the context of Chinese culture. In addition to the patient's internal barriers of resilience, specific family and socio-cultural barriers should also be emphasized by healthcare professionals. Multidisciplinary and family-centered resilience intervention should be developed to help such patients cope with, adapt to the disease, and achieve good psychosocial returns.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Trauma is nearly ubiquitous among women experiencing homelessness (WEH). WEH develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at rates far exceeding the general population. The consequences of untreated PTSD can cascade, exacerbating existing physical, mental, and social health inequities, placing this population at risk for disproportionate biopsychosocial health adversity. Despite the outsized impact of PTSD, WEH are less likely to access or receive appropriate trauma-focused services. Understanding the unique and intersecting factors that contribute to the disproportionate PTSD toll on WEH may elucidate risk and protective factors, as well as possible intervention pathways to address the disparate trauma burden. This study employed a qualitative descriptive approach to develop understanding of the determinants of trauma risk, exposure, and outcomes among WEH. Semi-structured interviews were completed with 10 WEH, six shelter staff, four mental health professionals. Six deductively biopsychosocial model-derived themes were identified, alongside supporting categories. Themes/categories highlighted the role of biological, psychological, and socio-environmental determinants in shaping risk for and actualization of traumatic events and adverse outcomes. Trauma played an outsized role in shaping the health of WEH participants in this study, and the need for and interest in tailored trauma screening, treatment, psychoeducation options was highlighted. Recursive relationships between biopsychosocial determinants and trauma impact were identified. Participants emphasized population tailored trauma-focused interventions, specifically brief co-designed and community partner implemented interventions that address substance use behaviors, while leveraging the strengths of WEH. Addressing the marked trauma burden in WEH shows promise in promoting measurable biopsychosocial health improvements in this resilient yet overlooked population.

N2  - PURPOSE: The present study aims to develop an explanatory framework to gain a deeper understanding of the resilience process in women diagnosed with gynecological cancers. METHOD(S): Informed by Salutogenesis Model, a Straussian-grounded theory study was conducted. In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 women with gynecological cancer between January and August 2022. Data were analyzed using open, axial, selective coding, and constant comparative methods. RESULT(S): The core category encapsulated that most women defined resilience as having a dynamic process that could be promoted throughout the process. However, they expressed that they needed "individual resources for resilience" and "generated resources by the supportive interventions" to be resilient. They emphasized that these resources should make the process manageable, meaningful, and comprehensible to promote resilience. Furthermore, they defined in detail which components should be included in supportive interventions. They stated "some reflections of resilience on their cancer process" and "life gains from the process." CONCLUSION(S): This study developed a grounded theory that provides a guideline for healthcare professionals on how women could be encouraged to have resilience and what is the importance of resilience on women's cancer process and their lives. Salutogenesis may help to understand the resilience process in women with gynecological cancer and provides direction for how healthcare professionals should shape their clinical interventions to promote the resilience process.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A virtual conversational agent is a program that typically utilizes artificial intelligence technology to mimic human interactions. Many robust and high-quality clinical trials have been conducted to test the effectiveness of conversational agent-based interventions. However, there is a lack of systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that evaluate the effects of artificial intelligence-driven conversational agents in healthcare interventions. OBJECTIVE(S): To examine the feasibility and effectiveness of conversational agent-based interventions evaluated by randomized controlled trials in the healthcare context, as well as to evaluate the information quality of artificial intelligence-driven conversational agents. DESIGN: A systematic review. DATA SOURCE: A systematic search of relevant literature published in English in Scopus, Pubmed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Information Science & Technology, and Web of Science, was performed. Only randomized controlled trials from the inception of the databases until May 2022 were included. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently selected the articles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study findings were narratively synthesized and summarized. The studies' risk of bias was evaluated using the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. The Silberg Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the conversational agent system utilized in each reviewed study. RESULT(S): Twenty-one studies were included in the data synthesis. The recruitment rates ranged from 34% to 100% (mean=84%), and completion rates ranged from 40% to 100% (mean=83%). A moderate to high level of intervention acceptability was reported. The intervention approaches included health counseling and education (n=8), cognitive-behavioral interventions (n=7), storytelling (n=1), acceptance and commitment therapy (n=1), and coping skills training (n=1). Findings indicated inconsistent effects on improving participants' physical activity and function, healthy lifestyle modifications, knowledge of the diseases, and mental health and psychosocial outcomes. The overall risk of bias varied from low risk (n=6) to high risk (n=7) across the studies. The mean Silberg score of included studies was 5.4/9, with a standard deviation of 1.6. CONCLUSION(S): Our review findings indicated that conversational agent-based interventions were feasible, acceptable, and had positive effects on physical functioning, healthy lifestyle, mental health and psychosocial outcomes. Conversational agents can provide low-threshold access to healthcare services. They can serve as remote medical assistants to support patients' recovery or health promotion needs before or after medical treatments. The conversational agent-based interventions can also play adjunctive roles and be integrated into current healthcare systems, which could improve the comprehensiveness of services and make more efficient use of physicians' and nurses' time.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - PURPOSE: The diagnosis of cancer in children can negatively impact their parents, owing to the complex treatment processes. Families with high levels of resilience can overcome these difficulties and thus perform higher family functions. We aimed to develop an internet-based family resilience-promoting program for parents of children with cancer and evaluate its effect on the levels of family resilience, depression, and family function. METHOD(S): This prospective, parallel-group, randomized-controlled study that was conducted at Yonsei Cancer Center from June to October 2021 included 41 parents of children with cancer. In total, four sessions of the internet-based family resilience-promoting program, led by a nurse, were conducted individually for parents. Levels of family resilience, depression, and family function were measured before, immediately after, and 4 weeks after the program. The data were analyzed using the linear mixed-effect model, and program satisfaction was evaluated through an internet-based questionnaire and interview. RESULT(S): The experimental group (the family resilience-promoting program participants) differed more significantly from the control group in the level of change in family resilience (beta = 13.214, p = 0.003, effect size = 0.374) and family function (beta = 1.256, p = 0.018, effect size = 0.394). However, there was no significant difference between the groups in the level of depression (beta = 2.133, p = 0.187, effect size = 0.416). All the program participants showed a high program satisfaction score of 4.75 out of 5.00 points overall. CONCLUSION(S): The applicability of the internet-based family resilience-promoting program as an appropriate nursing intervention was verified. Its application can help the families of children with cancer adapt to the stressful situation of their children's cancer diagnosis and treatment.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic changed not only the working conditions but also the private conditions we live in. Health care professionals especially were confronted with multiple stressors, e.g., the risk of infection, lack of staff, and high workloads. Method(s): To estimate some of the pandemic-related impacts this anonymous personnel survey was conducted in two German military hospitals (Hamburg and Berlin). This study presents a comparative analysis of the hospital staff in general vs. the psychiatric personnel (N = 685) at two measurement time points (MTPs) in April 2021 (n = 399) and December 2021 (n = 286). The survey contains the German version of the Covid Stress Scale (CSS) to assess the perceived level of pandemic-related stress, the Patient Health Questionnaire (German Version: PHQ-D) to screen for three major mental disorders, and the adjustment disorder-New Module (ADNM) to estimate the problems of adaptation to change. Result(s): The results showed a process of adaptation over the two MTPs with significant stress reduction at MTP2 in the general staff. The psychiatric staff did not report significantly higher pandemic-related symptoms. Quite the contrary, not only did the CSS show significantly lower xenophobia, traumatic stress, and compulsive checking, but the PHQ also showed lower stress symptoms and somatic symptoms at both MTPs. Also, the ADNM scores delivered evidence for a more effective adaptation process in psychiatric personnel (e.g., depressive mood, avoidance, anxiety). Discussion(s): The presented results must be interpreted while taking the unique situations of German military clinics into account. The supply of protective material was sufficient and there was no dramatic shortage of psychiatric staff during the pandemic. The inpatients were quite often (40%) elective treatments for trauma-related disorders, which could be discontinued in the case of a COVID-19 infection. The results of this study showed good adaptative skills among the psychiatric staff in military hospitals, which could be interpreted as a sign of good resilience. This might have led to lower stress-related symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2023 Willmund, Muller, Schneegans, Hollmer, Wesemann, Zimmermann and Helms.

N2  - AIMS: To investigate a theoretical model of risk and protective factors to predict resilience among adolescent disaster survivors. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHOD(S): Parent's consent and student's informed consent forms were distributed at seven schools in a postdisaster setting (Yogyakarta, Indonesia) between July-October 2017; those who agreed to participate had to complete the self-reported questionnaires. Demographic data were evaluated using descriptive statistical analyses and relationships among study variables were determined using a path analysis. RESULT(S): Results of the model test analysis indicated that six of the seven the hypothesized paths were supported by data from our samples and demonstrated significance on the path coefficients (p < .01). One path coefficient on the association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and resilience was found to be insignificant (beta = -0.002, p > .05). However, overall, our hypothesized model was retained, indicating empirical support and adequate model's fit indices for the theoretical model. CONCLUSION(S): Overall, the findings demonstrated the predictive roles of risk and protective factors in adolescent disaster survivors' resilience. IMPACT: Resilience is known to be an important concept in recovering from long-term impacts following a disaster in adolescent populations, but its risk and protective factors have not been adequately explored. We found that PTSD symptoms influenced how adolescent disaster survivors developed defensive coping, social support had an indirect effect on resilience through courageous coping and defensive coping acted as a mediator between PTSD symptoms and courageous coping. These findings can help mental health professionals (i.e., community mental health nurses) promote intervention strategies to enhance resilience through improving coping skills in adolescent populations exposed to a disaster.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Background: Psychological, emotional, and physical well-being are necessary for the development of caring and resilient physicians. In the current healthcare environment, medical trainees could be at risk of burnout which has led to the recent promotion of wellness in training programs by the Accreditation Councel for Graduate Medical Education. Our Geriatric Fellowship Program initiated a curriculum to enhance fellow wellness. Method(s): Fellows were exposed to a program called WISER (http://bit.ly/3wiser) in September which introduced bite size well-being strategies that were reviewed daily for 10 consecutive days. After participating in this intervention, the fellows collaboratively picked their favorite well-being activities to focus on. This included 3 Good Things, which is an opportunity to reflect on good things that occur throughout the day, and Moments of Awe, which includes purposeful observation of something that provokes amazement. Fellows are sent surveys via text messaging 4 days per week at 7pm to submit their responses in regard to their 3 Good Things and Moments of Awe. Result(s): After completion of the WISER intervention, fellows engaged in 3 Good Things and Moments of Awe and have submitted 59 responses for 3 Good Things during the previous 4 weeks for a response rate of 56.7%. Fellows have also uploaded 14 photos of Moments of Awe. During our weekly fellowship meetings, time has been set aside for discussing wellbeing activities as well as to review co-fellow's submitted responses to the Wiser interventions. Fellows have found the time commitment to be manageable for documenting 3 Good Things and Moments of Awe and have taken pleasure in engaging in these activities. Fellows have also created plans for social activities which have included dinner with inter-professional learners, birthday celebrations and group lunches. The fellowship clinical competency committee has now recommended setting a wellbeing goal for individual fellows as a standard part of the curriculum. Fellow wellbeing will be assessed via survey following the completion of the wellness curriculum in the next 4 months. Conclusion(s): We implemented a wellness curriculum in our fellowship program and have observed active participation of the fellows in this curriculum. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the individual components of the curriculum in the next few months.

N2  - Background and Objectives: Victimization is common in the United States, with individuals of color and from low socioeconomic communities disproportionately impacted. Many of these individuals are briefly cared for in the emergency department; however, the availability of mental health and social services following discharge is variable. The Trauma Recovery Center (TRC) model aims to address this gap by providing comprehensive mental health and case management for victims of crime. Currently, 39 TRCs exist nationwide, with $13 million allocated in state funding in California alone. Despite this rapid expansion of the TRC model, there is limited research on the implementation of TRCs. This scoping review was conducted to summarize the evidence for the TRC model. Method(s): Our scoping review followed PRISMA-P guidelines. Inclusion criteria were: (1) original research; (2) based in a TRC; and (3) an evaluation of services. To identify relevant literature, the PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo and Google Scholar databases were searched from January 2001 to March 2022. Search terms were related to victims of crime and psychosocial interventions. Additional sources were identified through expert-identified key articles. Identified articles first underwent abstract screening, following by full-text evaluation. Article review was conducted by two independent reviewers. Result(s): Five studies met inclusion criteria; two were located at the University of San Francisco TRC and three were based at the Long Beach TRC. Four of the five studies were retrospective cohort studies that evaluated predictors of access, initiation, and completion of treatment. Initiation of treatment ranged from 44.0% to 68.4%. Individuals with hyperarousal and distress were more likely to initiate treatment, whereas individuals with avoidance and post-traumatic stress disorder were less likely to initiate treatment. Individuals who were homeless and had weekly drug use were also less likely to start treatment. The fifth study was a randomized control trial that demonstrated that individuals who received care through the TRC were more likely to file for and receive victim compensation. Conclusion(s): Despite increasing implementation of the TRC model, existing knowledge of best practices is limited. Future evaluations of the TRC model are necessary to better understand the impact on patient outcomes and best practices in varying healthcare systems and populations.

N2  - Intro/Background: Many factors contribute to physician wellness, including perceived burnout, quality of life, job satisfaction, engagement, and fulfillment. When assessing burnout alone, >60% of emergency medicine physicians experience this phenomenon. Professional coaching may reduce emotional exhaustion and burnout as well as improve quality of life and resilience among physicians, stated by studies of internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatric physicians. Purpose/Objective: To date, no study has assessed the impact of coaching on the professional development and wellness of emergency medicine physicians. Additionally, prior studies relied on external professional coaches. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a novel coaching program utilizing internally-trained professional coaches for both individual and group coaching on wellness and professional development in residents, fellows, and clinical faculty in an academic emergency medicine department. Method(s): Between October 2020 and March 2021, seven departmental residents, faculty, and staff underwent training and certification as professional coaches. Beginning in January 2022, a pilot coaching program was implemented, utilizing these certified peer coaches, who were assigned to upper-level residents, fellows, and new faculty. Participants then underwent up to four individual coaching sessions. Group coaching sessions (n = 4) on topics ranging from leadership development to bedside teaching were also made available to the entire Department. Outcomes (if available): Baseline (Jan 2022) and follow-up (March 2023) demographics, burnout, and professional development data were collected using multiple instruments which included a 2-Question Summative Score of Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Physician Job Satisfaction Score. Participants were surveyed following each group session. Feedback reinforced coaching tactics (e.g., handouts, white boards, task assignment) and highlighted program deficits (e.g., few participants, education too vague). Participant and non-participant data will be compared at program conclusion. Summary: This novel program utilized internally-trained certified professional coaches within an academic emergency department (ED) for the coaching of faculty, fellows, and upper-level emergency medicine residents. Up to four individual coaching sessions were offered over the course of one year. The timing and number of these offerings will be refined based on our experience with the pilot program. Group coaching was offered four times over one year. The content topics for these sessions included: leadership in academic emergency medicine, niche development, best practices in bedside teaching, and avoiding burnout. Participants were surveyed after each group session for assessment of that session's domain but also for general session feedback. Pre-and post-implementation quantitative surveys assess for changes in burnout, professional development, and wellness among participants and non-participants. This research was been approved through the UNC Institutional Review Board. This program required an upfront departmental investment including the hiring of an external coaching company for training. However, ongoing financial costs incurred by contracting with outside professional coaches for continued coaching support may be augmented by using the new internal, certified peer coaches. In this way, the pilot program demonstrates the feasibility of implementing such a unique professional coaching model. Similar programs could be designed in other EDs, targeting professional growth and wellness topics appropriate for the population and environment. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Emergency Medicine physicians are experiencing challenges related to ED overcrowding, financial reimbursements, and professional identity. In this challenging career setting, peer coaching may improve professional satisfaction and overall personal wellness. With previously recognized benefits to other medical providers (e.g., decreased emotional exhaustion and improved quality of life), combined with the unique internal approach of peer-to- peer coaching, this novel program may present a significant return on investment.

N2  - Background: During the pandemic the Indiana Geriatrics Education and Training Center (GETC) began identifying learning needs for Area Agencies on Aging care managers (CM) and social workers (SW) and community health workers (CHW) from primary care (PC) centers. Learners expressed challenges with self-care attributed to working virtually with complex patients who had heightened pandemic related needs. Mindfulness has many positive effects: build resiliency, enhance creativity, boost emotional intelligence, and improve brain structure and function to produce improved mood. Selfcare, one domain of mindfulness, can be taught and lead to conscious stress reduction even in anxiety-producing situations. GETC partnered with the Indiana Family Social Services Administration Division of Aging and two local health systems to develop and deliver an Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) series to include a professional development segment on mindfulness. Method(s): An interdisciplinary team of GETC facilitators trained in the ECHO model developed sessions for CM, SW, and CHW. Each ECHO included a "mindful moment (MM)", a brief self-care didactic with resources for further study. MM provided evidencebased approaches to build a toolbox of self-care skills. Mindful topics included, but not limited to, awareness around being consciously present, gratitude, movement, social connectedness, importance of rituals and routines. Result(s): During a PC series conducted between September 2020 and September 2022, 10 ECHOs were provided to SW and CHW (average attendance 25). From May 2020-November 2022, 32 ECHOs were provided to CM (average attendance 371). Feedback on MM showed 96% of attendees found the content applicable to their work and improved their understanding of the topic. Themes from qualitative comments on feedback surveys showed mindfulness training was an important and necessary part of attendees' future education. The most helpful MM sessions covered breathing exercises, recommendations on self-care books and podcasts, and helping improve emotions. Conclusion(s): MM, as part of ECHOs, were found to include content helpful for self-care during stressful situations. Learners developed individual self-care toolboxes with skills and resources to help better utilize mindfulness in their daily practice.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged nurses and healthcare systems globally and raised major concerns for nurses' wellbeing and working conditions. This cross-sectional and correlational study design aims to describe nurses' resilience, job satisfaction, intentions to leave and quality of care, and explain their relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): Data were collected from Registered Nurses (N=437) in Finland through an electronic survey between February 2021 and June 2021. The questionnaire covered background characteristics (seven questions), resilience (four questions), job satisfaction (one question), intention to leave nursing (two questions), quality of care (one question), and requiring factors of the work (eight questions). The background variables and dependent variables were analyzed and presented using descriptive statistics. Structural equation modeling was used to explain dependent variables relationships. The study followed procedures recommended in the STROBE Statement for cross-sectional studies in efforts to maximize the quality of reporting results. RESULT(S): The surveyed nurses evaluated their resilience by mean score 3.92, more nurses had considered leaving nursing during the pandemic (16%) than before (2%). Nurses' mean score of requiring factors of the work was 2.56 and overall job satisfaction 5.8. Structural equation modeling revealed that resilience affected their job satisfaction, which also influenced the quality of care, that was rated moderate (7.46 out of 10). Structural equation modeling indices of goodness of fit were NFI=0.988, RFI=0.954, IFI=0.992, TLI=0.97, CFI=0.992, and RMSEA=0.064. No direct relationship was found between resilience and intention to leave nursing. CONCLUSION(S): Good resilience promoted delivery of high-quality care by nurses during the pandemic and enhanced their job satisfaction, which reduced their intention to leave nursing. The results indicate that it is important to develop interventions that support nurses' resilience. IMPACT: The study highlights the importance of nurses' resilience during the pandemic, while job satisfaction may decrease and requiring factors of the work increase. Given the number of nurses who consider leaving nursing, there are clear needs to develop effective strategies to maintain quality healthcare with resilient, committed nursing staff.Copyright © 2023.

T1  - Burnout in Academic Medicine: A Peripandemic Assessment
A1  - Wisniewska I.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - The impact of burnout on academic medicine has affected its 3 major missions-education, patient care, and research-in ways both similar to and dissimilar from the community practice of medicine. The authors have assessed major themes in the literature regarding burnout in health care professionals in academic medicine in the peripandemic periods-pre-, intra-, and postpandemic-to gain information on the impact of the pandemic on these perspectives. Additionally, burnout in military physicians, particularly in the military medicine academic community, was assessed to provide comparative perspectives on the factors of military training, personal resiliency, and unit cohesiveness on the development of, or resistance to, professional burnout. Overall, there are data to indicate an aggravation of burnout during the pandemic, but currently no long-term data to indicate a persistence of its effects over time on health care professionals beyond baseline prevalence identified prepandemic. Based on the assessments, recommendations are provided for future research, including clarification and standardization of the concepts of burnout, developing longitudinal studies on health care practitioner burnout status with preventive and/or mitigating interventions, and the special protection of certain professionals, including female physicians, physicians in training, and early-career faculty, including nonclinical researchers.

N2  - Social connections are vital for humans. Exploring the different impacts that social settings and relationships may have on experiential and physiological responses is essential for the understanding of the potential benefits of social resources in coping with stress and conflicts. This symposium explores how different experiential and physiological outcomes (such as cortisol levels and heart-rate variability) may be affected by the presence of or by the interaction with a parent, a physician, a romantic partner, or an unknown partner. Further, differential partner characteristics will be explored (gender, trauma-history, or emotional competences). The first presentation will describe a study comparing stress responses of preschoolers and their parents during an individual and a joint stress task. The results revealed a prolonged stress response during the individual condition and a stress buffering effect by the presence of a parent. A second presentation will show the extent to which a parent's past experience and current physiological reactivity may contribute to regulation difficulties in infants. In a third presentation, we will move to the examination of interactions, beginning with a physician-patient setting. The authors investigated to which extent the digitalization level in a context of stressful announcement interaction could buffer the patient's stress reaction, giving plural roads for physician training. In a fourth presentation, we will further explore the stress buffering effect of social settings by analyzing the impact of interpersonal touch, particularly with respect to the gender and the type of relationship with the social presence (partner or stranger). The interaction between these variables regarding the stress buffering effect of touch highlights the importance of social configurations when dealing with stressful situations. In a fifth presentation, we will focus on interpersonal physiological synchrony, especially on the extent to which emotional competence of two unknown partners in a conflicting interaction translate into specific heart-rate synchrony dynamics. Altogether, our different contributions provide a more nuanced view of the social elements favoring stress reduction and emotion regulation by bolstering the importance of considering the configuration of a particular social setting, the individual characteristics of the people involved, as well as the temporal course of stressful or difficult situations.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Purpose: This research aims to reveal the relationship between ingroup favoritism, seen as a theoretical cause of workplace violence experienced by physicians, with pre-violence, the moment of violence and post-violence, and the role of psychological resilience in coping with workplace violence. Design/methodology/approach: A descriptive, cross-sectional design was applied in the research. First, data was gathered via structured questionnaire surveys to the 169 physicians and 321 patients with appointments using the simple random sampling method in three public hospitals in the province of Sanliurfa-Turkey between June 3, 2020, and January 1, 2021. The data was then examined through variance-based structural equation modeling and regression analysis. Finding(s): Results indicate that the psychological resilience of physicians is essential in coping with workplace violence. The causes of favoritism behaviors were stated as a desire to protect the individuals they are with, increase their power, gain interest and cover their incompetence. It was determined that favoritism behaviors increase violence, but psychological resiliency decreases violence. Originality/value: Some unobservable markers that impose priority for a patient from one's primary group, favoritism, may predict behaviors including violence. Contrary to popular belief, violence against physicians may be prevented by hospital management and social psychology practices rather than taking legal actions or increasing physical safety procedures. Moreover, the simultaneous collection of the data used in the study from physicians and patients with an appointment makes the study more meaningful and unbiased.Copyright © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - AIM: This scoping review explored the main environmental factors in the workplace that contribute to nursing resilience in respiratory infectious pandemic events. BACKGROUND: There is strong evidence in the literature about the influence of individual factors on nurses' resilience and a growing interest on the impact of the workplace environment on these factors. Therefore, a review that synthesizes environmental factors that support nurses' resilience in pandemic events is timely. METHOD(S): A scoping review of publications written in English, Spanish, and Portuguese of registered publications until December 2020 in MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, SciELO, CINAHL, WoS, BVS, and APA identified 10,767 potential papers. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines were used during the literature review process. The Health Services Workplace Environmental Resilience Model (HSWERM) was used to guide exploration and synthesis. RESULT(S): Thirty-two (32) publications met inclusion criteria. Most of the HSWERM workplace factors were mentioned in the literature. The main workplace environmental factors that were identified included communication, inter-professional collaboration, access to equipment, targeted training, and supporting well-being. CONCLUSION(S): Recognition of these key environmental factors in the workplace will help to implement more effective actions to promote resiliency prior to and during emergency situations. It will also enable managers to include, in any preparation planning, contingencies to protect these factors with the view of sustainable resilience of nursing staff throughout the emergency event.

N2  - Background: In the event of emergency response to large-scale incidents, such as a mass casualty incident (MCI) or a mass casualty incident-infectious disease (MCI-ID), regular training is essential in order to have experienced emergency personnel available in the event of an incident. Due to the pandemic drills often had to be cancelled or were only possible with small groups of people. It was often not possible to simulate a large-scale emergency with actors, so that the trainees could not be offered realistic scenarios of a mass casualty or disease incident. As part of two research projects, a digital platform for conducting training was used to avoid the risk of infection between participants during the exercises, so that on-site personnel deployment could be reduced to a minimum. The goal of this work was to evaluate end-user acceptance of the digital solution approaches. Method(s): Within the framework of the project "Adaptive Resilience Management in Ports" (ARMIHN), a digital exercise platform was applied and evaluated with the help of participant surveys according to the focal points "implementation", "alternative possibilities", "learning effect" and "usability". The participants used the digital platform to exchange information and to communicate. For this purpose, various collaboration tools were embedded in the platform, which enabled simultaneous exchange of information in real time. Constant video communication with in-house and external authorities/teams was also established. Result(s): The potential of the digital platform as an alternative to on-site exercises was confirmed by the participating end users in the ARMIHN project with 90% agreement. The increase in subjective skills and knowledge gained during a MCI-ID was also predominantly rated approvingly (up to 70%). Participants who rated the implementation of the online format as well performed were significantly more likely to state that subjectively their ability to handle a MCI-ID had improved (p= 0.016). In contrast, virtual staff teamwork in real crisis situations was viewed critically by about half of respondents. Conclusion(s): Overall, the evaluation results point to the high end-user acceptance of the developed concept. Even though the aim is to evaluate the system over a longer period with a larger number of participants, the studies already conducted confirm the positive experiences in the respective projects.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionally affected the mental health of health and social care workers (HSCWs), with many experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Psychological interventions have been offered via mental health services and in-house psychology teams, but their effectiveness in this context is not well documented. Aims To evaluate a stepped-care psychological support pathway for HSCWs from Homerton Healthcare Foundation Trust in London, which offered psychological first aid, evidence-based psychological therapies and group-based well-being workshops. Method The service evaluation used a pre-post approach to assess depression, anxiety, functional impairment and post-traumatic stress disorder symptom change for those who attended sessions of psychological first aid, low- or high-intensity cognitive-behavioural therapy or a combination of these. In addition, the acceptability of the psychological first aid sessions and well-being workshops was explored via feedback data. Results Across all interventions, statistically significant reductions of depression (d = 1.33), anxiety (d = 1.37) and functional impairment (d = 0.93) were observed, and these reductions were equivalent between the interventions, as well as the demographic and occupational differences between the HSCWs (ethnicity, staff group and redeployment status). HSCWs were highly satisfied with the psychological first aid and well-being workshops. Conclusions The evaluation supports the utility of evidence-based interventions delivered as part of a stepped-care pathway for HSCWs with common mental health problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the novel integration of psychological first aid within the stepped-care model as a step one intervention, replication and further testing in larger-scale studies is warranted.Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

N2  - Background: Burn patients continue to have a high opioid requirement, despite current national trends to decrease opioid prescribing. While effective, long-term opioid use results in opioid dependence and possibly other mental health comorbidities. This retrospective cohort study seeks to evaluate implications of diagnosed opioid use disorder in the development of subsequent psychiatric, behavioral and substance abuse patterns. Method(s): The TriNetX database was queried for patients 18 years and older with a diagnosis of thermal or chemical burn who developed opioid use disorder after their burn injury. Two matched cohorts were studied, opioid use disorder versus non-opioid use disorder, to evaluate risk of developing subsequent mental health and behavioral conditions, use of psychiatric health services, and future substance abuse. Result(s): A total of 2020 patients were identified in each cohort, matched for demographics, external trauma, and burn size. Patients in the opioid use disorder group had a significantly higher incidence of mental health diagnoses (79.7 % versus 57.7 %, OR 1.973, CI 1.741-2.236, p < 0.0001), including major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This group was also more likely to utilize psychiatric services (16.0 % versus 10.3 %, OR 1.926, CI 1.595-2.326, p < 0.0001) and psychotherapy (12.6 % versus 7.2 %, OR 2.046, CI 1.650-2.536, p<0.0001). Furthermore, the opioid use disorder group had higher rates of polysubstance abuse (29.9 % versus 12.3 %, OR 3.048, CI 2.588-3.589, p<0.0001), suicidal / homicidal ideations (8.2 % versus 3.2 %, OR 3.057, CI 2.274-4.109, p<0.0001), and suicide attempts (2.0 % versus 0.7 %, OR 2.971, CI 1.611-5.478, p = 0.003). Conclusion(s): Burn patients who develop opioid use disorder have significantly higher rates of future psychiatric diagnoses, behavioral disturbances, and polysubstance abuse. A multidisciplinary team approach, including early involvement of pain and mental health services, could potentially reduce the development of opioid use disorder and its consequences.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and International Society of Burns Injuries

N2  - Families in Ireland often wait over 1 year to see a genetic counselor (GC). This qualitative study aimed to explore the views of families who received a diagnosis of 22q11DS in Ireland regarding the need for timely access to genetic counseling at the point of diagnosis. Twenty participants were recruited through the '22q Ireland' support group, giving a response rate of approximately 10% of the total support group members. Semi-structured interviews were conducted online and by telephone which explored experiences of receiving diagnoses, medical care, genetic counseling, mental health, and coping with the diagnosis. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. The experiences of 20 participants were classified into five main themes: Receiving Diagnosis, Interactions with Healthcare Professionals (HCPs, excluding GCs), Medical Care, Information, and Impact of Condition. Participants reported receiving diagnoses for their children in a sub-optimal manner due to inappropriate settings and insufficient information, support, and pre-test counseling. Parents reported feeling responsible for managing their child's complex and fragmented medical care. Participants reported insufficient empathy and little awareness of 22q11DS among HCPs. Participants perceived genetic counseling to be associated with family planning and reported delayed, if any, access to services. Mental health was a particular worry among participants. Conferences about 22q11DS are the main source of information for parents. Participants reported a range of emotions after diagnosis and described the family impact. The findings suggest both an association between HCPs' poor understanding of 22q11DS and the perceived lack of empathy from HCPs and fragmented medical care. There is an identified need for advocacy of the GC profession in Ireland to support these families. Increased awareness of 22q11DS among HCPs and the development of a coordinated care pathway for 22q11DS, with timely access to genetic counseling, may improve care and lead to better outcomes.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - Introduction: Annually, nearly half a million people in the U.S. receive medical treatment for burns, 40,000 of whom are hospitalized. Burn patients experience significant psychological burden during acute burn treatment. Long-term psychiatric problems are highly prevalent compared to patients with other injuries. Undetected or untreated psychiatric symptoms can complicate recovery, increase length of stay, and cause long-term problems and readmission. Burn centers are ideally suited to provide these services to burn patients on an inpatient and outpatient basis; however, few burn centers in the U.S. have mental health programs to address patients' needs This presentation will describe the Burn Behavioral Health (BBH) program, a burn center-based technology-enhanced stepped-care model of delivering mental health services for burn survivors, spanning the inpatient to outpatient continuum This model was adapted from the Trauma Resilience and Recovery Program which has been successful in meeting the needs of traumatic injury patients Methods: Data were collected as part of clinical care. BBH includes 4 main steps: (1) initial screening, education, and early intervention; (2) symptom self-monitoring and self-help resources; (3) follow-up screening 30 days post-injury; and (4) provision of best-practice mental health treatment for patients who need it, using both in-person and telehealth modalities including individual and skill-based group therapy Results: Between February 2021 and September 2022 384 patients were identified as eligible for BBH services. Of these, 342 (90%) were enrolled in BBH and completed initial screening. 50% of patients screened positive for depression/ PTSD risk or symptoms and were offered brief intervention 54% of enrolled survivors received brief intervention, 21% of whom completed more than one session. We reached 84% of patients for the 30-day follow-up, 20% of whom screened positive for depression/PTSD and 29% were connected to mental health services Conclusion(s): This study provides preliminary support demonstrating that BBH is sustainable and capable of reaching and engaging a large proportion of burn patients across the inpatient to outpatient continuum. In the U.S only 25% of burn centers have structured screening in place for inpatient and 11% for outpatient burn survivors. Data from the traumatic injury population (which includes burns) suggest only 10% of patients received intervention after a positive screen and 42% did not know how or where to get help. Psychological recovery is an essential component of a comprehensive burn program and availability of psychological screening and intervention is a requirement for the ABA verification Applicability of Research to Practice: BBH shows promise in increasing access and quality of mental health care to address the unique needs of burn survivors.

T1  - Strategies for Managing Impairing Emotional Outbursts

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Impairing emotional outbursts in youth significantly affect child and family functioning and confer enormous costs and burden on systems of care. Outbursts arise in the context of different disorders and psychosocial risk factors and often represent maladaptive or deficient coping strategies. Identifying modifiable factors that trigger and reinforce outbursts is key to preventing their recurrence. The goal is to generalize adaptive coping across environments, using evidence-based treatments that include parent management training and interventions based on CBT, to teach the child and family more effective observational, coping, and negotiation strategies. A shared approach and the strategic use of well-established interventions among health care professionals and across service systems would go a long way toward better addressing the needs of the most challenging children and families.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health.

N2  - Research on mental health professionals (MHPs) exposed to a shared war reality indicates that they are subject to emotional distress, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, and vicarious trauma. This article focuses on a CB-ART (cognitive behavioral and art-based) intervention implemented during the 2014 Gaza conflict with 51 MHPs who shared war-related experiences with their clients. The intervention included drawing pictures related to three topics: (1) war-related stressors, (2) coping resources, and (3) integration of the stressful image and the resources drawing. The major aims of the study were (1) to examine whether significant changes occurred in MHP distress levels after the intervention; (2) to explore the narratives of the three drawing and their compositional characteristics; and (3) to determine which of selected formats of the integrated drawing and compositional transformations of the stressful image are associated with greater distress reduction. Results indicate that MHP distress levels significantly decreased after the intervention. This stress-reducing effect was also reflected in differences between the compositional elements of the 'stress drawing' and the 'integrated drawing,' which includes elements of resources. Reduced distress accompanied compositional transformations of the stressful image. MHPs can further use the easily implemented intervention described here as a coping tool in other stressful situations.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Volunteers active in psychosocial emergency care offer psychological first aid to survivors of accidents and trauma, their relatives, eye witnesses, bystanders, and other first responders. So far, there are no studies that investigate the secondary and primary traumatization of this group of first responders. We included N = 75 volunteers, who filled out questionnaires to assess their secondary (QST/FST) and primary traumatization (PDS), and levels of comorbid psychological stress (PHQ-9, GAD-7, SF-12). We investigated factors of resilience by measuring attachment behavior (ECR-RD, RQ-2), level of personality functioning (OPD-SFK), sense of coherence (SOC-29), social support (F-SozU), and mindfulness (MAAS). The volunteers' levels of secondary and primary traumatization were below cut-off scores. Their levels of comorbid psychological stress were comparable to representative norm samples. Additionally, the volunteers presented high levels of resilience. Gender (beta = 0.26; p < 0.05), case discussions (beta = -0.37; p < 0.05), and social support (beta = 0.45; p < 0.01) were revealed to be predictors of secondary traumatization, while mindfulness turned out to be a predictor of primary traumatization (beta = -0.34; p = 0.008). However, we cannot rule out that the low prevalence of traumatization and comorbid psychological stress in our study sample might not be explained by a positive response bias.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Background: Many parents have difficulty managing childhood asthma. In Hong Kong (HK), while medication is the primary form of treatment, traditional Chinese medicine is another favored option. In addition, HK follows a dual-track healthcare system, which may pose unique experiences for Chinese parents in managing childhood asthma. This qualitative descriptive study aimed to explore the experiences of HK Chinese parents in caring for their children with asthma. Method(s): Fourteen HK Chinese mothers of children (aged 3-10) suffering from asthma were purposively sampled to participate in individual, semi-structured interviews. A realist approach following conventional content analysis was used to interpret the interviews. Result(s): The mothers expressed feelings of uncertainty, fear of asthma crises, and searched for ways to cope. As long as their child's asthma symptoms recurred, the mothers' distress continued. Their distress was sometimes exacerbated by self-doubt and worries over whether they would receive adequate support from their family and healthcare professionals. Conclusion(s): Helping parents to understand their limits may help them be more open to varied aspects of their caregiving experiences, and thus to cope better. Psychological interventions together with traditional educational training may help to alleviate the psychological difficulties of parents.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND Kidney transplantation (KT) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD) increase the incidence of morbidity and mortality associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on the psychological well-being of COVID-19 patients, especially those with a high-risk of infectious complications. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is known to be higher in ESRD patients undergoing HD than in the general population. On the other hand, KT recipients have different treatment requirements compared to HD patients, including adherence to complex immunosuppressive regimens and compliance with follow-up appointments. We hypothesized that psychosocial difficulties and stressors would differ between ESRD patients undergoing HD and KT recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic. If so, each group may require different interventions to maintain their psychosocial well-being. AIM To measure and compare the levels of stress, anxiety, depression, concerns related to the pandemic, and coping skills in ESRD patients undergoing HD and KT recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODS This cross-sectional study was performed at a training and research hospital. The study included ESRD patients undergoing HD (HD group) and KT recipients (with stable graft function for >= 6 mo prior to the study) (KT group). Patients completed a demographics form, the impact of events scale, the hospital anxiety and depression scale, and the Connor-Davidson resilience scale. Laboratory findings at the last clinical follow-up were recorded. The chi2 test was used to assess the relationship between the HD and KT groups and the categorical variables. The relationships between the scale scores were analyzed using Pearson's correlation test, and differences between the groups were analyzed using the independent groups t-test. RESULTS The study included 125 patients, of which 89 (71.2%) were in the HD group and 36 (28.8%) were in the KT group. The levels of anxiety and depression were higher in the HD group than in the KT group [9.36 +/- 4.38 vs 6.89 +/- 4.06 (P = 0.004) and 8.78 +/- 4.05 vs 6.42 +/- 4.26 (P = 0.004), respectively], whereas the post-traumatic stress score was higher in the KT group [46.75 +/- 13.98 vs 37.66 +/- 18.50 ( P = 0.009)]. The concern with the highest intensity in the HD group was transmission of COVID-19 to family and friends (93.3%) and in the KT group was loss of caregiver and social support (77.8%). Concerns regarding financial hardship, stigmatization, loneliness, limited access to health care services, failure to find medical supplies, and transmission of COVID-19 to family and friends were more prevalent in the HD group. Connor-Davidson resilience scale tenacity and personal competence, tolerance, and negative affect scores were higher in the KT group than in the HD group [43.47 +/- 11.39 vs 33.72 +/- 12.58, 15.58 +/- 4.95 vs 11.45 +/- 5.05, and 68.75 +/- 17.39 vs 55.39 +/- 18.65 ( P < 0.001), respectively]. Biochemical parameters, such as creatine, urea, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and calcium, were lower, and the albumin and hemoglobin values were higher in the KT group than in the HD group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Psychosocial difficulties and the level of stress differ in ESRD patients undergoing HD and KT recipients; therefore, psychosocial interventions should be tailored for each patient group.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Context: Provider grief, i.e., grief related to the death of patients, often forms an ongoing and profound stressor impacting healthcare providers' ability to maintain their sense of well-being, avoid feeling overwhelmed, and sustain quality and compassionate patient care over time. Objective(s): This narrative review presents findings on the types of interventions hospitals have offered to physicians and nurses to address provider grief. Method(s): Searches of PubMed and PsycINFO were conducted for articles (e.g., research studies, program descriptions and evaluations) focused on hospital-based interventions to help physicians and nurses cope with their own grief. Result(s): Twenty-nine articles met inclusion criteria. The most common adult clinical areas were oncology (n = 6), intensive care (n = 6), and internal medicine (n = 3), while eight articles focused on pediatric settings. Nine articles featured education interventions, including instructional education programs and critical incident debriefing sessions. Twenty articles discussed psychosocial support interventions, including emotional processing debriefing sessions, creative arts interventions, support groups, and retreats. A majority of participants reported that interventions were helpful in facilitating reflection, grieving, closure, stress relief, team cohesion, and improved end-of-life care, yet mixed results were found related to interventions' effects on reducing provider grief to a statistically significant degree. Conclusion(s): Providers largely reported benefits from grief-focused interventions, yet research was sparse and evaluation methodologies were heterogenous, making it difficult to generalize findings. Given the known impact provider grief can have on the individual and organizational levels, it is important to expand providers' access to grief-focused services and to increase evidence-based research in this field.Copyright © 2023 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine

N2  - This study aimed to elucidate the predictors and the effects of path modeling on the knowledge, attitude, and practice toward do-not-resuscitate (DNR) among the Taiwanese nursing staff. This study was a cross-sectional, descriptive design using stratified cluster sampling. We collected data on demographics, knowledge, attitude, and practice as measured by the DNR inventory (KAP-DNR), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale, and Dispositional Resilience Scale. Participants were 194 nursing staff from a medical center in northern Taiwan in 2019. The results showed that participation in DNR signature and education related to palliative care were significant positive predictors of knowledge toward DNR. The DNR predictors toward attitude included DNR knowledge, mindfulness, self-efficacy, dispositional resilience, and religious belief of nurses. Generally, the critical predictors of DNR practice were DNR attitude, dispositional resilience, and male nurses. In path modeling, we identified that self-efficacy, dispositional resilience, master's degree, and religious belief directly influenced practice constituting DNR. Based on the findings of this study, we propose that nurses should improve their self-efficacy and dispositional resilience through training programs. Encouraging staff to undertake further education and have religious beliefs can enhance the practice of DNR and provide better end-of-life care.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Nurses in geriatric care are exposed to various burdens in the workplace that result in high stress levels. The perceived stress may result in a lack of professional caring and burnout. Objective(s): The study aim was to identify work-related and personal factors that determine stress levels to design tailored interventions. Research design: cross-sectional study. Subjects: N = 195 geriatric nursing staff members. Measures: The survey included validated questionnaires (Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress (TICS), Health Survey Short form 12 (SF-12), Nordic Questionnaire) to identify work-related burdens, resulting stress levels and work-related behavior (AVEM). According to the limits of the Screening Subscale for chronic stress (SSCS) of the TICS, nurses were classified as stressed or non-stressed. With four-step regression analysis, main predictors for the stress level were identified. Result(s): The analysis revealed body postures, handling heavy loads, time pressure, deadlines and pressure to perform as the main burdens of the participants. Chronically stressed nurses showed different work patterns in comparison to nurses with lower stress levels. The regression analysis showed significance for the models including the work-related patterns and resilience aspects (step three (F (3.42) = 4.168; p = 0.010) and four (F (7.35) = 4.194; p = 0.002). Pattern B was a main factor for determining stress. The stress level determined the perceived burdens. Conclusion(s): Experiencing and managing stressors depends on the individual's perception, while coping patterns-especially pattern B-can be decisive. The tailored interventions to reduce stress in geriatric nurses should focus on personal patterns.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Rationale: Enhanced recovery after surgery(ERAS) involved multidisciplinary care which attenuates perioperative stress and promote early recovery. ERAS programs is associated with lower morbidity, shortened postoperative stay, and thus reduced cost. Traditionally, carbohydrate loading was provided to patients 2 hours before surgery. In patients undergoing ERAS hepatectomy, international data of length of stay(LOS) was 4-8days. According to our ERAS Hepatectomy Protocol, carbohydrate loading was provided 4 hours before surgery in Queen Mary Hospital(QMH). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether earlier administration of carbohydrates loading was equally efficacious in ERAS liver resection. Method(s): Protocol for ERAS(hepatectomy) was developed and commenced in September 2020 in QMH. After carefull selection for suitablilty of ERAS liver surgery, patients were assessed for malnutrition with C-MUST by team nurse. Before surgery, dietetics referral would be made if nutrition buildup or counselling is deemed necessary. Preoperative fasting was prevented. Carbohydrate loading (by dissolving 50g Polycal powder in 400ml water) was consumed by patients 4hours before surgery. Early postoperative oral intake was promoted and oral diet was allowed once assessed to be safe by doctors. Nutrition supplement wound be provided if oral intake was inadequate. Result(s): The study period started from September 2020 to end of December 2021. A total of 32 patients underwent hepatectomy under ERAS pathway in QMH. There were 23(71%)men and 9(28%) women with average age 62+/-8 years old (35-72 years old). Their mean body weight at admission was 67.6kg with BMI 24.8 +/- 3.2kg/m2. Among them, 29(91%) patients suffered from malignant disease. Half of the patients had surgery on the same day of admission. Oral nutrition supplement was provided to 26(81.2%) patients as their intake was found to be suboptimal. LOS since admission and after surgery(ALOS) were found to be 4.7+/-1.8days and 4.1+/-1.5days respectively. Their plasma albumin dropped from 43+/-4g/L before hepatectomy to 36+/-5g/L after operation. Patients undergoing liver surgery on the day of admission had significantly(p=0.00) shorter LOS(3.3+/-1.0days) than those with surgery carried out not on the day of admission (5.0+/-1.3days). No significant difference were found in plasma albumin and LOS between patient group with or without co-morbidities(diabetes, lipid, renal impairment), age or sex. Conclusion(s): LOS in the current study(4.7 days) was comparable to Hong Kong's cohort(4.9 days), Portugal's(3.9 days), UK's(4 days) and France's(4 days) while shorter than China's (6-8 days) and Korea's(5.8 days). ERAS hepatectomy on the day of admission seemed to be as efficient as or even better than those carried out at later days as LOS was found to be shorter. Amended carbohydrate loading at 4hours before surgery than universally suggested 2hours was found to be equally efficacious. ERAS pathway engaged multidisciplinary care with nutrition support playing important role. Disclosure of Interest: None declaredCopyright © 2022

N2  - First responders are routinely exposed to potentially traumatic events, such as workplace violence (WPV), which has been associated with a higher risk of developing psychopathologies. Perceived social support is a protective factor that may enhance first-responders' resilience in the face of violence. Specifically, the shared experiences of unique stressors among coworkers may lead to a sense of relatability that may help reduce WPV's psychological impacts above support from loved ones. Accordingly, the current study created a measure of coworker social support. We assessed how perceived social support from coworkers and personal supports moderated the relationship of WPV to psychopathology in first responders. A sample of active-duty firefighters (n= 117) and paramedics (n= 129) from a large Canadian city completed online measures of emotional psychopathology. Overall, we found that WPV positively predicted emotional psychopathology, but only at low levels of coworker social support. Consistent with a buffering effect, WPV was not associated with emotional issues at high levels of work support. In contrast, the level of personal social support from loved ones did not moderate WPV's negative impacts. We discuss the implications of our findings on the benefits of social support and support networks within the work environment.Copyright © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a relatively common diagnosis within military, veteran, and first responders (MVFR). However, there are issues with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) categorical approach to diagnosis of PTSD, especially the common co-occurrence of anxiety, depression, anger and substance abuse. In contrast, more recent research from the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOPS) and the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) suggest there are other ways of conceptualising the range, severity and contextual nature of symptom clusters within PTSD. Both these models are significantly more sophisticated and nuanced than the DSM model: they are dynamic; identify a spectrum of severity; account for environmental, social, genetic and other impacts on symptoms; and allow for integration of symptoms across different diagnostic categories within the complexity of mental illness presentations. The traumatic stress spectrum (TSS) model has significant clinical implications in that different symptom clusters may indicate prioritisation of different interventions before trauma-focused psychotherapies for the primary PTSD symptoms. Many MVFR may also benefit from psychoeducation and skills-based programmes for emotional regulation (ER), because ER is a higher-order domain that impacts on the range of TSS symptom clusters. The results of the Group Emotional And Relationships (GEARS) programme will be presented to demonstrate the TSS methodology in a clinical population. Objective(s): To educate, inform and increase the understanding of clinicians in alternative conceptualisations of PTSD and present the results of an intervention utilising a transdiagnostic model. Conclusion(s): PTSD includes more than intrusion and arousal symptomology, and transdiagnostic interventions can benefit individuals with a broad range of TSS symptom clusters.

N2  - Background: Military, veterans and first responders often present with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a range of comorbidities including anxiety, depression, anger and substance abuse. This complex picture can potentially undermine effective assessment and management of PTSD and other conditions. Objective(s): To inform participants of the theoretical background to explain transdiagnostic comorbidities around the diagnosis of PTSD using the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOPS) and the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). This traumatic stress spectrum (TSS) model seeks to span both adaptive and adverse reactions to trauma and explain the spectrum of symptoms within trauma-related psychopathology, as opposed to the traditional diagnostic categories. This introduction will be followed by three presentations that exemplify these issues in clinical practice, including: (a) an evaluation of the Australian Defence Force Second Opinion Clinic; (b) a data linkage evaluation utilising 000 calls from veterans in crisis; and (c) the advantages of a symptom cluster approach to medication choice, how we best use drugs to enhance results from psychotherapy and the treatment problems that result from pharmacological attempts at behaviour management.

N2  - ObjectiveTo review systematically community-based primary care interventions for epilepsy in low- and middle-income countries to rationalize approaches and outcome measures in relation to epilepsy care in these countries.MethodsA systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Global Index Medicus, CINAHL, and Web of Science was undertaken to identify trials and implementation of provision of antiseizure medications, adherence reinforcement, and/or health care provider or community education in community-based samples of epilepsy. Data on populations addressed, interventions, and outcomes were extracted from eligible articles.ResultsThe 24 reports identified comprise mostly care programs addressing active convulsive epilepsy. Phenobarbital has been used most frequently, although other conventional antiseizure medications (ASMs) have also been used, but none of the newer. Tolerability rates in these studies are high, but overall attrition is considerable. Other approaches include updating primary health care providers, reinforcing treatment adherence in clinics, and raising community awareness. In these programs, the coverage of existing treatment gap in the community, epilepsy-related mortality, and comorbidity burden are only fleetingly addressed. None, however, explicitly describe sustainability plans.ConclusionsCost-free provision, mostly of phenobarbital, has resulted in short-term seizure freedom in roughly half of the people with epilepsy in low- and middle-income countries. Future programs should include a range of ASMs. These should cover apart from seizure control and treatment adherence, primary health care provider education, community awareness, and referral protocols for specialist care. Programs should incorporate impact assessment at the local level. Sustainability in the long term as much as resilience and scalability should be addressed in future initiatives.

N2  - Objective: The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of implementing doctor-nurse integrated care combined with health education on joint function recovery, incidence of deep vein thrombosis, coping style, self-efficacy and nursing care satisfaction in patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. Method(s): This is a clinical prospective randomized study with 83 patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty in the orthopedic department of our hospital between May 2019 and May 2022 selected by a random number table. They were divided into 2 groups: the observation group (n = 42) and the control group (n = 41). Both groups used the integrated care model during the perioperative period. Patients in the observation group were also given health education and the differences in the incidence of lower limb deep vein thrombosis, hip function score, coping style, self-efficacy and nursing satisfaction in the 2 groups were compared. Result(s): Preoperatively, there was no statistically significant difference between the Harris Hip Score (HHS) in the observation group and the control group (P > .05); the HHS in the observation group was higher than in the control group at 2 weeks and 1 month after surgery, and the difference was statistically significant (P < .05); there was no statistically significant difference between the confrontation, avoidance and submission scores of the 2 groups the first day after surgery (P > .05); while the confrontation and avoidance scores in the observation group were higher than in the control group at 2 weeks after surgery, with statistical significance. There was no statistically significant difference between role function, emotional control, symptom management and nurse-patient communication scores in the 2 groups the first day after surgery (P > .05); while the emotional control, symptom management and nurse-patient communication scores in the observation group were higher than in the control group at 2 weeks after surgery, and the differences were statistically significant (P < .05). Overall patient satisfaction in the observation group was better than in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < .05). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of lower limb deep vein thrombosis in the 2 groups (P > .05). Conclusion(s): The implementation of an integrated care model combined with health education in patients with hip arthroplasty is beneficial to improving self-efficacy, patient trauma coping style, promoting early hip function recovery and improving nursing care satisfaction.

N2  - Introduction: Our aim was to determine the psychological and educational impact of the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting on the graduate medical education (GME) mission within two cohorts of resident physicians and attending faculty at two nearby academic trauma centers. Method(s): A cross-sectional survey assessed 55 resident physicians and attending faculty involved in the acute care of the patients from the mass shooting. We measured the psychological impact of the event, post-traumatic growth, team cohesion, social support, and known risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Additionally, we assessed the impact of the event on GME-specific tasks. Result(s): Attending faculty and physicians in training in GME residencies evaluated over 300 penetrating trauma patients in less than 24 hours, and approximately 1 in 3 physicians had a patient die under their care. Despite this potential for psychological trauma, the majority of clinicians reported minimal distress and minimal impact on GME activities. However, 1 in 10 physicians screened positive for possible PTSD. Paradoxically, the minority of physicians who sought psychological counseling after the event (20%) were not those who reported the highest levels of distress. Residents generally assessed the event as having an overall negative impact on their educational goals, while attendings reported a positive impact. Psychological impact correlated inversely with social support and the amount of prior education relating to mass casualty incidents (MCI) but correlated directly with the degree of stress prior to the event. Conclusion(s): Despite the substantial level of exposure, most resident physicians did not report significant psychological trauma or an impact on their GME mission. Some reported post-traumatic growth. However, a minority reported a significant negative impact; institutions should consider broad screening efforts to detect and assist these individuals after a MCI. Social support, stress reduction, and education on MCIs may buffer the effects of future psychologically traumatic events on physicians in training.Copyright © 2023 Guldner et al.

N2  - AIM: To design a protocol based on the experiences of long-term survivors to facilitate resilience for oesophageal cancer patients in rural China. BACKGROUND: According to the latest Global Cancer Statistics Report, 604,000 new cases of oesophageal cancer were reported, of which over 60% of the disease burden is distributed in China. The incidence of oesophageal cancer in rural China (15.95/100,000) is twice as high as those in urban areas (7.59/100,000). To be sure, resilience can help patients better adapt to post-cancer life. But universal interventions involving improving the resilience of oesophageal cancer patients have much less been explored, especially for rural patients. METHOD(S): The two-arm, parallel design, non-blinded, randomised controlled trial will be implemented in 86 adults diagnosed with oesophageal cancer and will be randomly assigned to the control group or the intervention group via the blocked randomisation. The intervention group will undergo an intervention with one-on-one guidance from a nurse while viewing a CD of the experiences of long-term survivors with oesophageal cancer in rural areas. Every 2weeks, a theme session will be introduced, and the entire intervention will continue for 12weeks. Psychosocial variables (resilience, self-efficacy, coping mode and family support) will be surveyed at baseline, post-intervention and 3 months after the intervention. The paper complies with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials 2013 and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines for study protocols adapted for designing and reporting parallel group randomised trials. CONCLUSION(S): The intervention programme transitions from hospitalisation to discharge, which includes one-on-one interventions by medical personnel and a portable CD describing the experiences of long-term survivors with rural oesophageal cancer. Once the intervention's effectiveness is proven, this protocol will provide psychological support for massive oesophageal cancer patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The intervention programme may be used as an auxiliary therapy to promote patients' postoperative psychological rehabilitation. This programme has the advantages of being cost-effective, flexible, accessible, and convenient and can be implemented without the limitation of time, place and clinical medical staff.

N2  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of the professional transition of new graduate nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: The transition from the role of student to the professional role can be challenging for new graduate nurses for the acquisition of higher autonomy and responsibility. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the quality of the professional transition. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional observational study following the Strengthening and Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist. METHOD(S): One hundred and two nurses who graduated in three consecutive sessions (November 2019-pre-pandemic, March 2020-pandemic outbreak, and November 2020-2nd wave) in a north Italian university located in the most affected Italian region by the COVID-19 pandemic, completed an online survey assessing well-being, risk of burnout, resilience, perceived stigma, strengths and limitations and quality of the professional transition. The study was performed between March and May 2021. RESULT(S): 81.4% of participants described the professional transition as worse than expected, and new graduate nurses who worked in COVID-19 settings reported a more difficult transition to professional life. No differences emerged in burnout, mental well-being and perceived stigma between new graduate nurses who worked in COVID-19 settings and those who did not. Similarly, no differences emerged amongst the three graduated cohort sessions. The most commonly mentioned challenges faced during the transition were organisational aspects, suddenly acquired autonomy and lack of suitable coaching. CONCLUSION(S): New graduate nurses reported a challenging academic-professional transition, in particular, those who worked in COVID-19 settings. The mid- and long-term impact of experiencing an academic-professional transition in COVID-19 settings should be assessed and monitored. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The professional transition of new graduate students should be adequately planned and monitored, new graduates should be assisted to develop realistic expectations about the transition, and an adequate coaching period should be guaranteed all the more during health emergencies.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - Aims: Despite a growing body of evidence for the psychological impact of adverse events on healthcare providers, the mechanisms underpinning the second victim (SV) phenomenon are not yet fully understood. As part of the validation of the WITHSTAND-psy Questionnaire (WS-PSY-Q), which measures SVs' psychological distress prior to and after the event and coping strategies, we aimed to describe depression and anxiety and the underlying risk factors in a sample of SVs. Method(s): Using an online survey (284 participants, including 229 women and 55 men), depression and anxiety were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory-Form Y (STAI-Y), respectively, which served as gold standards for the validation of the WS-PSY-Q. Descriptive statistics and odds ratios were computed using Stata 17. Result(s): In our sample, 20.42% of participants showed comorbidity of depression and anxiety (BDI-II >= 16, STAI-Y >= 40). While 38.03% of SVs experienced only anxiety (BDI-II < 16, STAI-Y >= 40), no one (0%) suffered from depression alone (BDI-II >= 16, STAI-Y < 40). Consequently, odds ratio analyses identified as risk factors for anxiety a short time frame between adverse event and questionnaire compilation (i.e., less than one month, OR = 0.22, p = 0.002), a high degree of perceived responsibility for the adverse event (OR = 1.14, p = 0.005) as well as an existing blame culture at the workplace (OR = 2.74, p = 0.004). Conclusion(s): Our findings expand the understanding of the second victim phenomenon and underline the importance of creating a safer, more supportive, just, and resilient healthcare environment. Increased efforts are needed to ensure comprehensive psychological support for emotionally distressed healthcare providers.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Background Dyadic coping may play an important role in promoting marital adjustment in couples with breast cancer. However, few studies have explored dyadic coping and its predictors in couples with breast cancer. Objective To assess the dyadic coping level of Chinese couples with breast cancer and identify its predictors and explore the actor and partner effects of marital adjustment on dyadic coping. Methods Chinese couples (n = 114) with breast cancer participated in a cross-sectional study and completed the general information questionnaire, the Dyadic Coping Inventory, the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test, and the Body Image Scale. Results Total scores of the Dyadic Coping Inventory were 114.09 (SD, 18.49) and 114.62 (SD, 17.42) for the patients and partners, respectively. Relationship duration, monthly family income, postoperative time, adjuvant treatments, marital adjustment, body image, and dyadic coping style of the partners predicted dyadic coping among patients with breast cancer. In addition, marital adjustment exhibited both actor and partner effects on dyadic coping in the couples. Conclusions Dyadic coping in couples with breast cancer in China was in the reference range. Psychosocial characteristics, marital adjustment, and body image should be considered and evaluated when conducting interventions for couples with breast cancer. Implications for Practice When conducting interventions for couples with breast cancer, nurses should identify couples who are likely to adopt negative dyadic coping styles and then conduct targeted interventions that consider psychosocial characteristics, marital adjustment, and body image in couples with breast cancer.

N2  - Background Coping strategies are essential in dealing with threatening situations or difficulties for better psychological adjustments and quality of life. A short-form modified Ways of Coping Questionnaire (MWCQ) would be useful to quickly assess the coping strategies used by breast cancer survivors. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of a brief version of the MWCQ in breast cancer survivors. Methods A methodological, cross-sectional design was used in this study. The study has internal consistency reliability, face/content, construct, and convergent/divergent validity. Factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to examine the psychometric properties of the MWCQ-brief in a convenience sample of 207 women with breast cancer from 2 general hospitals in Taiwan. Results From the initial 35-item coping scale, factor analysis results supported a 24-item questionnaire, and the following 4 factors were extracted: effective coping, optimistic coping, unpractical coping, and escape coping. Confirmatory factor analysis results revealed an 18-item questionnaire with 3 factors extracted: Active coping, avoidance coping, and minimizing the situation. Conclusions The 24- and 18-item MWCQ-brief versions demonstrate fair psychometric properties to measure adaptability among women with breast cancer in Taiwan. This scale is simple but contains 4 or 3 concepts for coping that can be appropriately used to assess underlying states of adaptation in women with breast cancer. Implications for Practice The MWCQ-brief is a valid and reliable tool to understand the adaptability states of female breast cancer survivors by exploring reactions to the disease. Healthcare professionals can provide appropriate psychosocial interventions based on assessment results. Copyright © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Background: The role of multidisciplinary clinics for psychosocial care is increasingly recognized for those living with inherited cardiac conditions (ICC). In Canada, access to healthcare providers differ between clinics. Little is known about the relationship between access to specialty care and a patient's ability to cope with, and manage their condition. Method(s): We leveraged the Hearts in Rhythm Organization (HiRO) to conduct a cross-sectional, community-based survey of individuals with ICC and their family members. We aimed to describe access to services, and explore the relationships between participants' characteristics, cardiac history and self-reported health status and self-efficacy (GSE: General Self-Efficacy Scale) and empowerment (GCOS-24: Genetic Counseling Outcome Scale). Result(s): We collected 235 responses from Canadian participants in 10 provinces and territories. Overall, 63% of participants reported involvement of a genetic counsellor in their care. Access to genetic testing was associated with greater empowerment [mean GCOS-24: 121.14 (SD = 20.53) vs. 105.68 (SD = 21.69); p = 0.004]. Uncertain genetic test results were associated with lower perceived self-efficacy (mean GSE: uncertain = 28.85 vs. positive = 33.16, negative = 34.13; p = 0.01). Low global mental health scores correlated with both lower perceived self-efficacy and empowerment scores, with only 11% of affected participants reporting involvement of psychology services in their care. Conclusion(s): Differences in resource accessibility, clinical history and self-reported health status impact the perceived self-efficacy and empowerment of patients with ICC. Future research evaluating interventions to improve patient outcomes is recommended.Copyright 2023 Davies, Allan, Carroll, Gibbs, Roberts, MacIntyre, Steinberg, Tadros, Dorian, Healey, Gardner, Laksman, Krahn, Fournier, Seifer and Lauck.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although slack is an asset to resilient hospitals, it is usually explicitly discussed only in terms of the quantity and quality of beds and staff. This paper expands this view by addressing slack in four infrastructures of intensive care units (ICUs) (physical space, electricity supply, oxygen supply, and air treatment) during the COVID pandemic. METHOD(S): The study occurred in a leading private hospital in Brazil, aiming at the identification of slack in four units originally designed as ICUs and two units adapted as ICUs. Data collection was based on 12 interviews with healthcare professionals, documents, and comparison between infrastructures and regulatory requirements. RESULT(S): Twenty-seven instantiations of slack were identified, with several indications that the adapted ICUs did not provide infrastructure conditions as good as the designed ones. Findings gave rise to five propositions addressing: relationships intra and inter infrastructures; the need for adapted ICUs that match as closely as possible the designed ICUs; the consideration of both clinical and engineering perspectives in design; and the need for the revision of some requirements of the Brazilian regulations. CONCLUSION(S): Results are relevant to both the designers of the infrastructures and to the designers of clinical activities as these must take place in fit-for-purpose workspaces. Top management might also benefit as they are the ultimate responsible for decision-making on whether or not to invest in slack. The pandemic dramatically demonstrated the value of investing in slack resources, creating momentum for this discussion in health services.Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

N2  - Background Despite the stress inherent in a cancer diagnosis, many cancer survivors report benefits, including perceptions of personal growth and well-being. Among adults 60 years or older, for whom cancer diagnoses are most prevalent, there is a notable lack of research on positive psychological change. Objective This mixed-methods study was designed to advance current understanding of positive psychology (ie, posttraumatic growth, well-being) in older adults with cancer. Methods Fifty-six older adult cancer survivors were recruited through a statewide cancer registry and the community. Participants completed questionnaires on posttraumatic growth, well-being, coping, and quality of life, as well as a series of open-ended questions via mail. Results Participants reported high posttraumatic growth and well-being and primarily adaptive and emotion-focused coping strategies. They also reported better mental quality of life (P =.0001) but not physical quality of life (P =.31) compared with age-adjusted population norms. Older age was associated with less posttraumatic growth (r = -0.32, P =.02) but not well-being (P =.34). Qualitative responses emphasized appreciation and acceptance and a reliance on faith and social support and provided context for quantitative results. Conclusions This mixed-methods study suggests that older adults report positive psychological change and adaptive coping with cancer, demonstrating their high level of emotional resilience. Implications for Practice Mental health screenings should be provided as appropriate, but oncology nurses should also consider the potential for positive psychological change postdiagnosis. The provision of care and social support may need to be modified to accommodate older cancer survivors' needs. Copyright © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective:To investigate whether a workplace, group mindfulness-based yoga intervention could help manage burnout and improve wellbeing among health care professionals. Method(s):A total of 43 health care professionals participated in 8-week supervised workplace, group mindfulness-based yoga activities. The authors used a single-sample, pre-post design. At two points in time (baseline and postintervention), participants completed a set of online measures assessing burnout, depression, anxiety, stress, resilience, and compassion. The authors used linear mixed model analysis to assess changes in outcome measures. Result(s):Participants had improvements after the 8-week intervention. At postintervention, they had significantly better scores on personal accomplishment, depression, anxiety, stress, perceived resilience, and compassion. Participants had a positive perception of the yoga intervention. Conclusion(s):Group mindfulness-based yoga program may be convenient and low-cost approach to support health and wellbeing among health care professionals.

N2  - PURPOSE: Students pursuing higher education and health professional (HP) programs (e.g., nursing, pharmacy, social work, medicine) experience stressors including academic pressures, workload, developing professional competencies, professional socialization, the hidden curriculum, entering clinical practice and navigating relationships with colleagues. Such stress can have detrimental effects on HP students physical and psychological functioning and can adversely affect patient care. This study examined the role of perceived social support and resilience in predicting distress of Atlantic Canadian HP students during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared the findings to a pre-COVID population of age and sex matched Canadians. METHOD(S): Second year HP students (N=93) completed a survey assessing distress, perceived social support, and resilience and open-ended questions on student awareness of supports and counselling available to them, their use/barriers to the services, and the impact of COVID-19 on their personal functioning. HP student responses were also compared with age and sex matched Canadian peers from data collected prior to COVID-19. RESULT(S): It was found that HP students reported moderate to severe psychological distress, and while they reported high levels of social support on a measure of perceived social support they also reported that the COVID-19 pandemic made them feel isolated and that they lacked social support. It was found that the sample of HP students reported significantly higher psychological distress than the mean scores of the age and sex matched sample of Canadian peers. CONCLUSION(S): These findings call for creation of more tailored interventions and supports for HP students.Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

N2  - AIM: Cognitive concerns are one of the most frequently reported symptoms by breast cancer survivors. This study aimed to evaluate perceived cognitive functioning in Portuguese women with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study enrolling 146 women (73 with breast cancer and 73 healthy) was conducted from August to October 2017, invited to participate through online dissemination. Participants completed self-reported questionnaires to collect sociodemographic and clinical data and assess perceived cognitive functioning and psychological adjustment variables (anxiety and depression). RESULT(S): Compared to healthy women, women with breast cancer showed significantly lower scores on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) subscales and higher levels of depression. Both groups showed significant negative correlations between perceived cognitive functioning and anxiety and depression. Health status and depression seem to better explain perceived cognitive functioning, with health status adding significantly more explained variance beyond sociodemographic and psychological adjustment variables. CONCLUSION(S): The current findings provide evidence for the existence of more cognitive complaints among Portuguese women with breast cancer, compared to healthy individuals. Anxiety, depression, age and education also explain perceived cognitive functioning. Considering that health status and psychological adjustment seem to significantly explain perceived cognitive functioning, special attention should be given by health-care professionals, including nurses, to designing clinical interventions for breast cancer patients to help manage cognitive impairment.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

T1  - Relationships Among Rumination, Resilience, Mindfulness, and Perceived PTSD Symptoms in Military Veterans Returning to College: A Cross-Sectional Study
A1  - Reyes A.T.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - The influx of military Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) returning to college following active military service presents an unmanageable trend for many secondary educational institutions in the United States. The current study aimed to determine relationships among rumination, resilience, mindfulness, and perceived PTSD symptoms in college student Veterans. To this end, 133 college student military Veterans registered in a U.S. university responded to an online survey. Results revealed that rumination has a direct effect on perceived PTSD symptoms and mediates the relationship between mindfulness and perceived PTSD symptoms, and that resilience moderates the relationship between mindfulness and perceived PTSD symptoms through rumination as the mediator. These findings imply that designing and developing mindfulness-based interventions for college student Veterans with PTSD requires concerted efforts targeted at improving ruminative thinking and enhancing resilience.

N2  - Psychological resilience helps individuals to actively respond to various emergencies, but its mediating role between the rumination and post-traumatic growth (PTG) of nurses remains unknown. Our study aimed to explore the extent to which psychological resilience mediates the association between rumination and PTG among nurses working in mobile cabin hospitals. This cross-sectional survey was conducted on 449 medical team members working in mobile cabin hospitals to support the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 in Shanghai, China in 2022. Pearson correlation analysis was applied to assess the correlation between rumination, psychological resilience, and PTG. Structural equation models were used to examine the mediating role of psychological resilience between rumination and PTG. Our study results showed that deliberate rumination directly promoted psychological resilience and PTG and had positive effects on PTG through the mediating effect of psychological resilience. Invasive rumination had no direct effect on PTG. However, it had a negative effect on PTG through the mediating effect of psychological resilience. Together the results of this study indicate that the mediating effect of psychological resilience was significant in the association of rumination and PTG among mobile cabin hospital nurses, with a higher individual psychological resilience level helping nurses to achieve PTG. Therefore, targeted interventions should be implemented to improve nurses' psychological resilience and guide their rapid growth.Copyright © 2023

N2  - Background/Objectives: Prior research has established the potential for negative quality-of-life consequences among individuals with suspected Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI). Relatively underrepresented in this literature, however, are qualitative methods that explore patient perceptions of their challenges and opportunities. This study aims to interrogate psychosocial impacts of having an IEI to better understand how patients adapt to their condition. Method(s): A survey including open-ended questions was sent to patients enrolled on the Centralized Sequencing Protocol and were suspected of having an IEI. Here, we present responses to the question: What has been most helpful in learning to live with your illness? And why?. Result(s): Out of 1038 invited participants, 252 (24% response rate) responses were coded and analyzed thematically (59% female, mean age = 48 years). Many patients reported that they benefit from competent providers with a nuanced understanding of their disease and who provide effective treatments. Patients also reported seeking support in coping from family, friends, and the disease community. Many also reported the benefit of lifestyle changes and reconceptualizing their illness to gain a sense of control. An important minority of individuals indicated they had not found anything helpful in living with their illness. Conclusion(s): Beyond encouraging further biomedical research into new disease associations and therapies, patient responses suggest healthcare providers can promote adaptation by encouraging patients to play an active role in their treatment and connecting them to support systems and psychological interventions. Patients who claim no adaptation can benefit from practices to better identify their challenges and corresponding interventions.

N2  - Background Multi-modular motion-assisted memory desensitization and reconsolidation therapy (3MDR) is a new psychological intervention for people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 3MDR is immersive, delivered in a virtual reality environment, and emphasises engagement, recollection and reprocessing. Objective Through a theory-driven examination of data relating to 10 out of 42 UK military veterans taking part in a trial of 3MDR, the principal objective was to explore the complex interrelationships between people, interventions and context and to investigate how factors within these domains interacted in specific outcome typologies. Method Quantitative and qualitative data relating to 10 trial participants were derived from: researcher-assessed and self-report clinical measures; interviews; physiological recordings; words describing thoughts and feelings during therapy; and subjective unit of distress scores. Using a convergent mixed methods approach, data were tabulated using a person, intervention and context model. Participant summaries were grouped into outcome typologies, followed by an analysis of data convergence and divergence within each and an interpretation of identified patterns. Results Three outcome response typologies were identified: dramatic improvement, moderate improvement and minimal improvement. Within the person domain, factors associated with outcomes included walking capacity, commitment and ability to complete therapy, and levels of subjective distress. Within the intervention domain, factors associated with outcomes related to image selection and use, therapeutic alliance and orientations towards the tailoring of sessions. Within the context domain, factors associated with outcomes included reactions to the therapy environment. The patterning of secondary outcomes broadly corresponded with primary outcomes within each typology. Alongside patterned data differentiating aspects of the person, intervention and context domains, within the three response typologies data also existed where no obvious patterning was detected. Conclusions The model developed here may have novel value in evaluating a range of personalised interventions, but further work is needed before confident assertions can be made of who is likely to benefit from 3MDR specifically.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coaching has been shown to decrease physician burnout; however, coachee outcomes have been the focus. We report the impact of coaching on women-identifying surgeons who participated as coaches in a 9-month virtual program. METHOD(S): A coaching program was implemented in the Association of Women Surgeons (AWS) to determine the effects of coaching on well-being and burnout from 2018 to 2020. AWS members volunteered and completed training in professional development coaching. Pre- and post-study measures were assessed, and bivariate analysis performed based on burnout and professional fulfillment score. RESULT(S): Seventy-five coaches participated; 57 completed both pre- and post-study surveys. There were no significant changes in burnout or professional fulfillment including the Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationship, Meaning, and Accomplishment scale, hardiness, self-valuation, coping, gratitude, or intolerance of uncertainty scores from baseline to post-survey. On bivariate analysis, hardiness was associated with lower burnout throughout the duration of the program. Coaches with lower burnout at the end of the program met with their coachee more frequently than coaches with higher burnout [mean (SD) 3.95(2.16) versus 2.35(2.13) p=0.0099]. DISCUSSION: Burnout and professional fulfillment demonstrated no change in women surgeons who participated as professional development coaches. Those with lower burnout and higher professional fulfillment at the end of the program were found to have higher hardiness, which may be worth future investigation. CONCLUSION(S): Acquisition of coaching skills did not directly improve well-being in faculty who participated in a resident coaching program. Future studies would benefit from control groups and exploration of qualitative benefits of coaching.Copyright © 2023. The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Societe Internationale de Chirurgie.

N2  - Background. Public Health Center is the front line that plays a major role in disaster preparedness and management, so efforts are needed to increase the resilience of the Public Health Center to ensure that the Public Health Center remains resilient, safe and continues to operate in the event of a disaster. To prevent the impact of paralysis of health services at the Public Health Center, a tool is needed to measure the resilience of the Public Health Center. Objective. This research aims to identify indicators of Public Health Center resilience which were synthesized from various sources. Methods. This research was a cross-sectional study among 30 Public Health Centers in flood-prone areas of East Java Province that experienced floods from September to October 2021. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the suitability of the structural model of Public Health Center resilience. The validity of the questionnaire has been tested using the Coefficient of Reproducibility and Coefficient of Scalability with values of Kr = 0.903 and Ks = 0.903 so that it is declared valid. Results. The results showed that the reliability value = 0.843>0.7, which indicates adequate reliability. All items in the Health Center Resilience questionnaire have a factor loading greater than 0.32 and obtained AVE > 0.5, which indicates good convergent validity, and CR obtained > 0.7 means that the ques-tions in the questionnaire are reliable. Conclusion. In conclusion, there are 13 indicators that make up the significant Public Health Center Resilience questionnaire. ercial use onl.Copyright © the Author(s), 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The well-known COVID-19 pandemic totally transformed people's lives, paving the way to various psychopathological symptoms. In particular, patients may experience a short- and long-term decreasing in their wellbeing. In this vein, the aim of this paper was to assess the COVID-19 patients' psychopathological profile (post-traumatic stress disorder, distress, anxiety and depression symptoms), detecting possible differences linked to the ventilatory treatments. METHOD(S): Outpatients who recovered from COVID-19 were asked to provide socio-demographic and clinical information, and to complete a brief psychological screening evaluation (Impact of Event Scale-Revised [IES-R], Depression Anxiety Stress Scale [DASS-21]). RESULT(S): Overall, after informed consent, 163 Italian patients took part in this research. Of them, 31.9% did not undergo any ventilatory therapy, 27.6% undertook oxygen therapy, 28.2% underwent noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 12.3% received invasive mechanical ventilation. Although no statistically significant differences were revealed among patients stratified by spontaneous breathing or ventilatory therapies, they reported statistically significant more depression (4.5+5.2 vs. 3.5+3.2; P=0.017) and anxiety (4.3+4.5 vs. 2.4+2.6; P<0.00001) symptoms than normative groups. Moreover, patients experiencing COVID-19 disease as a trauma, complained statistically significant higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms than who did not describe a clinically relevant traumatic experience (P<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Thus, this study suggests to healthcare professionals to consider COVID-19 experience as a potential real trauma for patients, and underlines the necessity to define patients' psychopathological profile in order to propose tailored and effective preventive and supportive psychological interventions.Copyright © 2022 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA Online version at https://www.minervamedica.it.

N2  - Objective Despite calls to increase the 'cultural competence' of health care providers, racially minoritised people continue to experience a range of problems when it comes to health care, including discrimination. While relevant qualitative meta-syntheses have suggested better ways forward for health care for racialised minorities, many have lacked conceptual depth, and none have specifically investigated the relational dimensions involved in care. We set out to investigate the social and cultural influences on health care interventions, focusing on psychological approaches and/or cancer care to inform the trial of a new psychological therapy for those living with or beyond cancer. Method A meta-ethnography approach was used to examine the relevant qualitative studies, following Noblit and Hare, and guided by patient involvement throughout. Papers were analysed between September 2018 and February 2023, with some interruptions caused by the Covid pandemic. The following databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO CINAHL, Ovid Embase, EBSCO PsycINFO, Proquest Sociology Collection (including Applied Social Sciences Index & Abstracts (ASSIA), Sociological Abstracts and Sociology Database), EBSCO SocINDEX, Ovid AMED, and Web of Science. The systematic review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (ID: CRD42018107695), and reporting follows the eMERGe Reporting Guidance for meta-ethnographies (France et al. 2019). Results Twenty-nine journal papers were included in the final review. Themes (third-order constructs) developed in the paper include the centrality of the patient-practitioner relationship; how participants give meaning to their illness in connection to others; how families (rather than individuals) may make health decisions; how links with a higher power and spiritual/religious others can play a role in coping; and the ways in which a hierarchy of help-seeking develops, frequently with the first port of call being the resources of oneself. Participants in studies had a need to avoid being 'othered' in their care, valuing practitioners that connected with them, and who were able to recognise them as whole and complex (sometimes described in relational languages like 'love'). Complex family-based health decision-making and/or the importance of relations with non-human interactants (e.g. God, spiritual beings) were frequently uncovered, not to mention the profoundly emergent nature of stigma, whereby families could be relatively safe havens for containing and dealing with health challenges. A conceptual framework of 'animated via (frequently hidden) affective relationality' emerged in the final synthesis, bringing all themes together, and drawing attention to the emergent nature of the salient issues facing minoritised patients in health care interactions. Conclusion Our analysis is important because it sheds light on the hitherto buried relational forces animating and producing the specific issues facing racially minoritised patients, which study participants thought were largely overlooked, but to which professionals can readily relate (given the universal nature of human relations). Thus, training around the affective relationality of consultations could be a fruitful avenue to explore to improve care of diverse patients.Copyright © 2023 Ridge et al.

N2  - Despite the unprecedented wave of research and publications sparked by the recent pandemic, only few studies have investigated the impact of COVID-19 on the Italian community-based system of mental health care. We aimed to summarize the available evidence from the literature also considering what we have learned from our daily clinical practice. As hospital care was restricted by COVID-19, although reducing their opening hours and activities, Community Mental Health Centers promoted continuity of care for at-risk populations, supporting them to cope with loneliness and hopelessness during quarantine and self-isolation. Ensuring continuity of care also remotely, via teleconsultation, lowered the risk of psychopathological decompensation and consequent need of hospitalization for mental health patients, with satisfaction expressed both by patients and mental health workers. Considering what we have learned from the pandemic, the organization and the activity of the Italian community-based system of mental health care would need to be implemented through 1) the promotion of a "territorial epidemiology" that makes mental health needs visible in terms of health care workers involved, 2) the increase of mental health resources in line with the other European high-income countries, 3) the formalization of structured initiatives of primary care and mental health cooperation, 4) the creation of youth mental health services following a multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach and encouraging family participation, 5) the promotion of day centers, to build competence and self-identity within a more participatory life, and programs geared to employment as valid models of recovery-oriented rehabilitation.Copyright © 2023, Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

N2  - Background: Treatment inanintensive care unit (ICU) is both stressful and psychologically traumatic for patients. Many mental disorders can arise following traumatic and stressful events, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Studies have investigated nurses' and patients' views on the stressors in a typical intensive care unit. However, there have been inconsistencies in the results of these studies. Moreover, only a limited number of studies have been conducted on this issue in Iran. Objective(s): This study aimed to compare patients' and nurses' views of the traumatic stressors inherent in intensive care units. Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted on 120 patients who were hospitalized in intensive care units, as well as 60 nurses in the intensive care units, in2014. The study instrument consisted of two parts, namely a demographic questionnaire (age, sex, level of education for nurses, and length of hospitalization for patients) and Cochran and Ganong's modified intensive care unit environmental stressor scale. All the nurses and literate patients answered the questionnaire through self-report. However, illiterate patients were interviewed and their answers were recorded in the questionnaires. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the independent samples t-test. Result(s): The mean scores of the stressors were 123.23 +/- 17.81 and 125.16 +/- 17.35 from the nurses' and patients' viewpoints, respectively (P > 0.05). A lack of control over urine and stool, fear of death, pain, and havinga tube inthe mouth ornose were the most important stressors from both the patients' and nurses' viewpoints. Moreover, the mean stressor scores were approximately the same in both groups for the first eight stressors. Conclusion(s): Nurses and patients had approximately similar views as to the top eight stressors in the average intensive care unit. However, it seems that nurses not only need more training in appraising intensive care unit patients' stressors, but also in how to reduce or eliminate those stressors. Such an approach could be of importanceinthe provisionof high quality care due to reducing stressors and meeting patients' care-related needsinintensive care units. Hence, early intra-ICU clinical psychological intervention may help critically ill trauma patients recover from this stressful experience.Copyright © 2016, Trauma Monthly.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The coworkers of nurses who died because of COVID-19 infection generally experience a highly emotional grieving process. Nurses grieving the loss of a coworker during the COVID-19 pandemic experience higher psychological stress because of their high workload and the grueling shifts required to manage health emergencies during the pandemic and cope with long-standing staffing shortages. The limited number of studies discussing this issue has resulted in insufficient evidence necessary to develop effective counseling strategies and psychological support for nurses in Indonesia dealing with the massive waves of COVID-19 cases. PURPOSE: This study was designed to elucidate the experiences of nurses across four provinces in Indonesia who had experienced the loss of a colleague during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): A qualitative research design and phenomenological approach were used in this study. Sampling was done in Jakarta, Bali, East Java, and East Nusa Tenggara using purposive sampling for the first eight participants and snowball sampling for the subsequent 34 participants. Semistructured, in-depth interviews were used to collect data from 30 participants using appropriate ethical principles. Data saturation was achieved after interviewing 23 participants, and their data were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULT(S): Three main themes related to nurses' responses to the death of a colleague, distinguished into several stages, were identified. Stages in the first theme were as follows: (a) shocked to hear of colleague's death, (b) self-blame for failing to save a life, and (c) afraid to experience the same situation. Stages in the second theme were as follows: (a) make efforts to avoid the same thing from happening again, (b) develop strategies to avoid thoughts of loss, and (c) expect to have a psychological support system. Stages in the third theme were as follows: (a) seek new reasons, goals, directions, and meanings in life and (b) improve the physical and social health of individuals. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The range of responses from nurses to the death of a colleague during the COVID-19 pandemic identified in this study may be referenced by service providers to better provide psychological assistance and support to nursing staff. In addition, the coping strategies described by the participants provide detailed information that healthcare providers may use to deal with nurses facing death more comprehensively. This study emphasizes the importance of developing strategies to help nurses cope positively with their grief from a holistic perspective, which may be expected to impact positively the performance of nurses.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience impairments in their social interactions, language communication, and stereotypical patterns of behavior. Parents of children with ASD experience higher levels of stress and more depression and anxiety than parents of children with other disabilities or typically developing children. Parents of children with disabilities develop coping strategies to counteract the stresses associated with raising a child with special needs. Understanding coping strategies to help counteract the stresses associated with parenting a child with ASD may enhance well-being in parents of children with ASD, improve the quality of care provided to these children, and foster better parent-child relationships. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the coping strategies used by parents in Taiwan parenting a child with ASD. METHOD(S): In this descriptive qualitative study, thematic analysis was conducted on data collected during face-to-face interviews. Fourteen parents of children with ASD were recruited using purposive sampling. Researchers employed a teamwork approach for data analysis to increase the dependability and consistency of the transcribed interviews. Team members discussed coding and identified the themes collaboratively. RESULT(S): Taiwanese parents of children with ASD coped with the psychological impacts of parenting by employing problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies. Problem-focused strategies included communication, support, and management, whereas emotion-focused strategies included acceptance and adaptation. Findings showed that both coping strategies were useful in addressing specific situations and circumstances. Social and clinical support improved parents' mental health and children's external behaviors. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: Healthcare providers should evaluate how parents are coping with the stresses related to raising a child with ASD and consider the cultural factors that might influence how they accept and adapt to parenting children with ASD. Understanding these variables may be used to tailor strategies appropriate to reducing stress and improving the well-being of parents and their children. Support and resource referrals should be considered, including parent support groups, books, web-based services, and recommendations for professional consultations with social workers or therapists.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - HIV care services have been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in many states in the U.S. including South Carolina (SC). However, many HIV care facilities demonstrated organizational resilience (i.e., the ability to maintain needed health services amid rapidly changing circumstances) by addressing challenges to maintaining care during the pandemic. This study, therefore, aims to identify key facilitators for organizational resilience among AIDS Services Organizations (ASOs) in SC. In-depth interviews were conducted among 11 leaders, from 8 ASOs, across SC during the summer of 2020. The interviews were recorded after receiving proper consent and then transcribed. Utilizing a codebook based upon the interview guide, a thematic analysis approach was utilized to analyze the data. All data management and analysis were conducted in NVivo 11.0. Our findings demonstrate several facilitators of organizational resilience, including (1) accurate and timely crisis information dissemination; (2) clear and preemptive protocols; (3) effective healthcare system policies, management, and leadership; (4) prioritization of staff psychological wellbeing; (5) stable access to personal protective equipment (PPE); (6) adequate and flexible funding; and (7) infrastructure that supports telehealth. Given the facilitators of organizational resilience among ASOs in SC during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is recommended that organizations implement and maintain coordinated and informed responses based upon preemptive protocols and emerging needs. ASO funders are encouraged to allow a flexibility in spending. The lessons learned from the participating leaders enable ASOs to develop and strengthen their organizational resilience and experience fewer disruptions in the future.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - Introduction Psilocybin-assisted therapy has shown significant promise in treating the cluster of mood and anxiety symptoms that comprise post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but has yet to be tested specifically in this condition. Furthermore, current pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD are difficult to tolerate and limited in efficacy, especially in the US Military Veteran (USMV) population. This open-label pilot study will examine the safety and efficacy of two psilocybin administration sessions (15 mg and 25 mg), combined with psychotherapy, among USMVs with severe, treatment resistant PTSD. Methods and analysis We will recruit 15 USMVs with severe, treatment resistant PTSD. Participants will receive one low dose (15 mg) and one moderate/high dose (25 mg) of psilocybin in conjunction with preparatory and post-psilocybin therapy sessions. The primary safety outcome will be the type, severity and frequency of adverse events and suicidal ideation/behaviour, as measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. The primary outcome measure for PTSD will be the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale-5. The primary endpoint will be 1 month following the second psilocybin administration session, and the total follow-up time will be 6 months. Ethics and dissemination All participants will be required to provide written informed consent. The trial has been authorised by the Ohio State University Institutional Review Board (study number: 2022H0280). Dissemination of results will occur via a peer-reviewed publication and other relevant media. Trial registration number NCT05554094.Copyright © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: Adopting diabetes self-care behaviors to control blood glucose is essential, but adherence to them has been challenged due to restrictions related to Covid-19. These restrictions have negatively impacted the psychosocial condition of individuals with diabetes, which could lead to poor self-care. Accordingly, this study aimed to explore the experiences of individuals with type 2 diabetes regarding self-care behaviors and diabetes management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): This qualitative study was conducted using conventional content analysis, the data of which were collected through interviews with people over 18 years of age with type 2 diabetes who were selected from the Endocrinology Clinic of Erfan Hospital in Tehran. Using telephone and WhatsApp, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 participants (15 women). Content analysis was done using the constant comparative method, and the open and axial coding method was applied. The data were manually coded, and the main themes and categories emerged from data. Result(s): Two main themes emerged from the data: 1) challenges and limitations toward diabetes self-care and 2) facilitators of efficient self-care. Challenges and limitations included 4 sub-themes: Inevitable lifestyle changes, psychosocial problems, limited/lack of access to health care services and medication, and adverse physical effects. Facilitators had 2 sub-themes: improved individual capability and maintaining social interaction. Conclusion(s): Our findings indicated that inevitable lifestyle changes, limited access to health care, and adverse psychosocial consequences were the most critical challenges for diabetes management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improving stress management skills and effective coping strategies can facilitate the adoption of self-care behaviors.Copyright © 2022, Research Institute for Endocrine Sciences. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Post-intensive care unit recovery programs for survivors of critical illness related to COVID-19 remain limited, ever-evolving, and under active investigation. Mental health professionals have an emerging role within this multidisciplinary care model. Objective(s): This article explores the design and implementation of an intensive care unit follow-up clinic in New Orleans during the era of COVID-19. Survivors of a critical illness due to COVID-19 were offered multidisciplinary outpatient treatment and systematic psychological screening up to 6 months after the initial clinic visit. Method(s): We implemented a prospective, observational study at a post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) clinic for survivors of a critical illness related to COVID-19 embedded within an academic Veterans Affairs hospital. Our team identified patients at high risk of PICS and offered them a clinic consultation. Patients were provided the following interventions: review of the critical care course, medication reconciliation, primary care, psychopharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and subspecialty referrals. Patients were followed up at 1- to 3-month intervals. Psychological symptom screening was conducted with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition, 9-question Patient Health Questionnaire, and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessments. Result(s): Seventy-seven total patients were identified to be at high risk of PICS from March to November 2020, and of this cohort, 44 (57.14%) survived their COVID-19 hospitalizations. Of the surviving 44 patients contacted, 21 patients established care in the PICS clinic and returned for at least 1 follow-up visit. At initial evaluation, 66.7% of patients demonstrated clinically meaningful symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. At 3-month follow-up, 9.5% of patients showed significant post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety were present in 38.1% of patients at initial evaluation and in 4.8% of patients at 3 months. Moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression were present in 33.4% and 4.8% of patients at initial visit and at 3 months, respectively. Conclusion(s): A PICS clinic serves as a posthospitalization model of care for COVID-19 intensive care unit survivors. This type of health care infrastructure expands the continuum of care for patients enduring the consequences of a critical illness. We identified a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression, along with other post- intensive care unit complications warranting an intervention. The prevalence of distressing psychological symptoms diminished across all domains by 3 months.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s)

N2  - Objective: The objective of this Clinical Update is to review the principles, structures, processes, and outcomes of community systems of care as they pertain to the delivery of behavioral health care to children and adolescents Method: A search of the literature on this topic from 2002 was initially conducted in 2016 and repeated in 2019 and 2021, yielding 1,604 English-language citations. These citations were supplemented by references suggested by topic experts and identified through Web searches, increasing the yield to 1,684 total citations, of which 1,184 were unduplicated. After sequential review by Update authors at title/abstract and then full-text levels, the citations were winnowed to 156 based on relevance to the topic. Result(s): The systems of care approach, arising in the 1980s, expanded child and adolescent behavioral health care from the core services of psychotherapy, medication management, inpatient psychiatric services, and residential treatment to include home- and community-based treatment and support services; promotion, prevention, and early intervention programs; and specialized services for very young children and youth and young adults of transition age. These services and supports are delivered by a large multidisciplinary workforce and are governed by key principles, including a biopsychosocial case conceptualization; family-driven, youth-guided, strengths-based, and trauma-informed care. Services in the least restrictive setting; continuity of care across transitions; a public health framework for service delivery; promotion of wellness and resilience; and elimination of health disparities. Challenges to systems of care implementation include funding availability, workforce shortages, deficiencies in cross-systems collaboration, and variability in insurance coverage. Although controlled studies have failed to provide convincing evidence of favorable outcomes from the whole systems of care approach, uncontrolled research has demonstrated increased access to care, positive clinical and functional outcomes, improved family functioning, and reductions in costs, particularly when research is focused on specific behavioral health problems, specific interventions such as Wraparound care, or highly specified groups of youth. Conclusion(s): Health professionals who are educated in the systems of care approach can improve access to and quality of behavioral health care for children and adolescents with behavioral health needs.Copyright © 2022 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry

N2  - BACKGROUND: Moral resilience is the integrity and emotional strength to remain buoyant and achieve moral growth amid distressing situations. Evidence is still emerging on how to best cultivate moral resilience. Few studies have examined the predictive relationship of workplace well-being and of organizational factors with moral resilience. RESEARCH AIMS: The aims are to examine associations of workplace well-being (i.e., compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress) and moral resilience, and to examine associations of workplace factors (i.e., authentic leadership and perceived congruence of organizational mission and behaviors) and moral resilience. RESEARCH DESIGN: This study uses a cross-sectional design. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: Nurses practicing in a hospital in the United States were surveyed using validated instruments (N = 147). Individual factors were measured using demographics and the Professional Quality of Life Scale. Organizational factors were measured using the Authentic Leadership Questionnaire and a single item measuring organizational mission/behavior congruence. Moral resilience was measured using the Rushton Moral Resilience Scale. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The study was approved by an institutional review board. FINDINGS: Resilience was noted to have significant small correlations with burnout, secondary traumatic stress, compassion satisfaction, and organizational mission/behavior congruence. Burnout and secondary traumatic stress predicted less resilience, whereas compassion satisfaction and perceived congruence between organizational mission and behaviors predicted higher resilience. DISCUSSION: Burnout and secondary traumatic stress, increasingly experienced by nurses and other health professionals, have negative effects on moral resilience. Compassion satisfaction can increase resilience, which is especially important in nursing. Organizational practices promoting integrity and confidence can have positive effects on resilience. CONCLUSION(S): Continued work to confront workplace well-being issues, especially burnout, is needed as a way of increasing moral resilience. Studies of organizational and work environment factors to bolster resilience are likewise needed to assist organizational leaders in devising the best strategies.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Being a medical student, it is really important to balance all sorts of emotions either positive or negative. Desensitization plays a significant role in shaping medical students' way to become efficient physicians. In this article, we discuss the effectiveness of experiential learning from the early medical student days such as in cadaveric dissection hall, operation theatre, and clinical rotation. The journey of desensitization among medical students is beneficial in situations that require emotional resilience over emotional instability. Experiential learning helps medical students in knowledge retention and a better understanding of their learning strengths and areas of improvement.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

T1  - Culturally informed approaches in early psychosis intervention care
T3  - 14th International Conference on Early Intervention in Mental Health, IEPA 2023. Lausanne Switzerland.
A1  - Sage M. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Aim: The early psychosis intervention (EPI) field has only recently begun exploring integration of culturally informed values, perspectives and practices. Mental health is defined as a social construct based on belief systems about illness. Definitions of mental health vary across cultures, and social norms and expectations shape the content of symptoms and how they are interpreted. Diagnosis and interpretation of mental illness has roots in colonialism, racism, and systems of oppression and individuals accessing mental health services benefit from integrating their experiences within cultural, social, and historical contexts This presentation aims to describe the deliberate integration of culturally informed values, perspectives, and practices into EPI care Methods: Through a review of the literature, this presentation will draw on research focusing on the integration of culturally informed approaches into EPI care. It will highlight the centring of healing and growth in ways that fit the values and beliefs of individuals and their natural supports Results: Themes relating to addressing historical trauma, exploring cultural worldviews and beliefs about health and mental health, and focusing on the impact of poverty, racism, and discrimination will be discussed. The data will be presented through a lived experience lens with the presenter sharing her own lived experience of mental health trauma, wellness, and recovery in the centring of approaches that fit individual, family, and community values, perspectives, and practices Conclusion(s): The integration of culturally informed approaches addresses health disparities for youth at risk of developing psychosis and those experiencing a first episode of psychosis.

N2  - Introduction: Psychosocial factors play a significant role in postoperative recovery, yet little is known about the experience of clinicians in assessing and mitigating these challenges for older adults in the perioperative time period. We interviewed clinicians to understand the current state of psychosocial assessment and impacts of psychosocial strengths and challenges on the experience of older adults undergoing surgery. Method(s): Semi-structured interviews were conducted with an interdisciplinary group of clinicians. Interviews explored the influence of psychological and social factors on the experience of older adults undergoing major surgery, focusing specifically on physical, cognitive, emotional, social, and psychological components. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using an inductive approach. Result(s): Fifteen individual clinicians completed interviews (5 surgeons, 4 social workers, 3 primary care physicians, 2 nurses, and 1 physical therapist). Clinicians discussed three themes: (1) psychosocial strengths and vulnerabilities impact perioperative outcomes with psychosocial supports, strength, resilience, cognitive reserve all playing into a good recovery, (2) identification of a lack of a rigorous or standardized program for psychosocial support, and (3) suggestions for improvement such as routinely addressing common psychosocial issues preoperatively to help anticipate challenges that may arise during recovery. Conclusion(s): Clinicians caring for geriatric surgical patients lack specific and practical tools to address psychosocial challenges, which hinders routine assessment. Clinicians emphasized the importance of assessing psychosocial support and providing pre- and postoperative education to normalize common concerns, especially the emotional aspects of recovery. Given these data, there is a need to develop a patient-centered mechanism to assess psychosocial strengths and vulnerabilities.

T3  - 14th International Conference on Early Intervention in Mental Health, IEPA 2023. Lausanne Switzerland.
A1  - Reininghaus U. 
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Aims: Most mental disorders emerge in youth. Whereas evidence for early intervention is promising, availability and use of youth mental health services remain limited. Therefore, the development of youthfriendly low-threshold interventions is urgently needed. Method(s): In this symposium, we will present a series of digital interventions targeting transdiagnostic mechanisms in daily life. Result(s): First, data on an Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) targeting low self-esteem in youth exposed to childhood adversity will be presented. Then we will discuss the effects of a novel hybrid compassion-focused EMI for improving resilience in youth with early mental health problems. Subsequently, findings from another blended digital and face to face transdiagnostic intervention for young people with psychosis and borderline personality disorder are discussed. And finally, a hybrid intervention investigating Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in Daily Life in individuals with early psychosis is presented. Conclusion(s): Digital interventions may be a promising translational strategy for prevention and early intervention of psychotic and other severe mental disorders. These interventions may have the potential to increase engagement with care in case of successful implementation.

N2  - The physical aspects of ultrasonography, difficult posture with prolonged pressure exertion, have been extensively researched and addressed with advances in machine ergonomics, operator awareness of posture and positioning and workplace tools to identify musculoskeletal problems. The mental stresses are less well recognized and have only recently started getting investigated. Ultrasonography is a mentally challenging activity requiring long periods of intense concentration, empathy and communication of complex and often difficult information to patients and clinicians, all of which carries an emotional toll. Practitioners are also under increasing time and caseload pressures exacerbated by COVID recovery and chronic fatigue from two years of pandemic. A survey of UK obstetric sonographers showed 92.1% and 91.0% met the burnout thresholds for exhaustion and disengagement, respectively).1 While many Trusts provide training to support physical health, few radiology departments educate their staff on emotional resilience or offer regular support to either promote or maintain mental wellbeing. Training, when available, is often focused on the receiver and not on the impact of vicarious traumas experienced as a result of repeatedly discovering/delivering difficult outcomes to patients on a regular and prolonged basis. Few health professionals are face-to-face with their patient at point of significant discovery whether that information is imparted to the patient or not. Mental health professionals have adopted a traumainformed stance into their working practices. This has not only informed the direct clinical work with patients but is also evident in the way the workforce is supported by the trust. Regular supervision, reflective practice and debriefs are required and monitored by the trust, based on research in clinical psychology to inform best practice. Some of these practices could be applied to physical health professionals to address some of the emotional burdens experienced as part of day-to-day delivery of care.

T3  - North American Neuromodulation Society 26th Annual Meeting. Las Vegas United States.
A1  - Watson E.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Introduction: A detailed psychological evaluation is an important tool utilized by physicians to help predict the success of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy. Psychological factors such as anxiety, depression and mood disorders may play a large predictive component in SCS failure. The high coexistence between depression and chronic pain, however, can complicate the picture. Recent studies have substantiated this complexity, and have started to place more value on the psychosocial and behavioral factors such as coping mechanisms, and social support. Herein, the authors present an interesting case of a 47 year old female with a significant psychiatric history that had significant improvement in her mood and overall mental health after SCS implant. Method(s): A 47 year-old-female with a significant psychiatric history including bipolar disorder, ADHD, and multiple suicide attempts with subsequent inpatient psychiatric evaluations presented to our office with chronic low back and radicular pain. After failing conservative pharmacological management, interventional treatments, and surgical lumbar fusion, the patient elected to proceed with SCS therapy. She underwent clinical neuropsychological evaluation to assess neurocognitive, behavioral and psychological factors associated with the proposed procedure. On evaluation the patient fit criteria for clinical depression, however her cognitive skills were not found to be adversely affected, and therefore there were no significant psychosocial factors to predict poor response to SCS therapy. Result(s): The patient underwent a successful SCS trial, followed by permanent implantation. At initial follow up, she reported greater than 85% improvement in pain as well as mood. At monthly follow-up visits, she continued to report improvement in mood and quality of life, including a decreased incidence of insomnia as well as continued improvement in mental health. This was also noted by her psychiatrist. Conclusion(s): Depression, anxiety and mood disorders are often heavily intertwined with chronic pain. The overlap of psychological and chronic pain symptoms suggests a shared mechanism of action for both disorders. This is supported by the large degree of supported pharmacological remedies that are utilized successfully for both depression and chronic pain. Recent studies have demonstrated considerable overlap between pain and depression induced neuroplasticity. As evident by our case report, inhibitory pathways important for controlling pain in the spine may also have a significant role in the effects on mood.

N2  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare and potentially fatal thrombotic microangiopathy, caused by a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. There is growing evidence of the long-term disease burden in TTP, including cognitive impairment, reduced quality of life and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Since August 2020, the Liverpool TTP Centre team has included a psychologist. The ideal service model integrating psychological services into TTP patient care is currently unknown. This retrospective, single-centre study reviewed TTP patients referred to the psychology service over 15 months (August 2020-November 2021). There were 508 TTP clinic appointments during this time, and 12/75 patients reviewed in the TTP outpatient clinic were referred to psychology: median age 52 years, two thirds female, 8/12 white ethnicity and majority not in regular employment (9/12). Patients were referred a median of 56 months from diagnosis. All patients were in a clinical remission at the time of referral; with a median ADAMTS13 activity 49 iu/dL [IQR: 20, 67 iu/dL]. All referrals were from the TTP consultant/ specialist nurse. Reasons for referral were varied, with low mood/depression being the most common (5/12). Other reasons included anxiety, neurocognitive symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidal ideation. The median time from referral to first consultation was 65 days [IQR: 25, 129 days] and the median number of psychology sessions delivered was 4 [IQR: 2, 12]; 4/12 patients disengaged from therapy prior to completing their sessions. Patients reviewed underwent a variety of assessments; GAD7 score for anxiety, PHQ8 depression scoring, WEMWBS mental wellbeing score, PTSS-14 post-traumatic stress score and RBANS cognitive assessment. The most common intervention offered was narrative therapy (6/12); brain injury rehabilitation and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) were also used. Our observations suggest that a relatively low proportion of TTP patients are referred for psychology input, generally at the time of clinical remission, directed primarily by the specialist TTP team versus patient self-referral. Of those referred, most patients engaged with the psychology services offered and went on to receive specialist interventions. This is the first report describing the initial experience of integrating psychology services into TTP patient care in the UK. Further work is required to determine the ideal referral pathway to facilitate timely and effective psychological support. Optimising this aspect of TTP care is crucial towards improving the short and long-term quality of life for patients with TTP.

This study explores the common mental health challenges in university students and their coping strategies using social support in the first wave of lockdowns in Dhaka city in 2020. By learning from young people's impacts and coping responses, we can help build an improved strategy for future events of this magnitude. Method(s): A qualitative study design was employed to conduct 20 in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions with students from purposively selected three public and three private universities in Dhaka city and five key informant interviews with different stakeholders. We used inductive reflexive thematic analysis and applied six phases of the thematic analysis. Codes retrieved from two differently prepared codebooks were merged and compared to identify themes for a fair interpretation of the underlying data. Data were manually indexed, summarized, and interpreted to categorize codes into sub-themes leading to themes. Result(s): Financial constraints, academic pressure, learning resources shortages, losing confidence, relationship breakup, excessive internet dependency, and traumatic experiences challenged the mental health conditions of the students unevenly across universities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expressed mental health well-being impacts ranged from anxiety, stress, and depression to self-harm and suicidal ideation. Family bonding and social networking appeared as robust social support mechanisms to allow students to cope with anxiety, stress, and depression. Partial financial subsidies, soft loans to purchase electronic resources, faculty members' counseling, and sessional health counseling contributed to minimizing the mental health impacts of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Mental health is still not a resourced area of health and well-being in Bangladesh. Concentration on developing strong social support and improving increased financial subsidies, including learning resources, can be effective in assisting students in coping with the common mental health burdens during pandemic periods. A national intervention plan should be immediately designed and implemented by engaging different stakeholders including healthcare professionals and establishing effective mental healthcare support centers at universities to avoid immediate and prolonged negative mental health impacts.Copyright © 2023 Billah, Rutherford, Akhter and Tanjeela.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown that medical students experience a great level of burnout and poor well-being during their clinical training periods. In this study, we sought to understand how military medical students cope with stress to prevent burnout and support their well-being. We also investigated if these coping strategies are associated with military medical students' self-reported well-being, burnout, and depression levels. The findings could help inform programming, resources, and educational strategies to better support students to thrive in their careers long term. METHOD(S): Using a cross-sectional research design, we surveyed military medical students and conducted content analysis on participant responses to the open-ended item by trained coders. Coding was based on the existing coping theory frameworks as well as categories that emerged inductively to represent the data. RESULT(S): The primary four strategies military medical students utilized included social connection (59.9%), exercise (58.3%), personal relaxation (36%), and work-life balance (15.7%). The use of work-life balance strategy was significantly associated with more positive well-being and lower depression compared to those who did not use this strategy. Three main coping typologies were further extracted, including personal care, connection, and cognitive strategies. Based on the typologies, 62% of students were recognized as multi-type copers (who combined more than two coping typologies), who reported significantly more positive well-being compared to students who relied on a single typology. CONCLUSION(S): The findings demonstrate that certain coping strategies are more positively associated with a good state of well-being and less burnout, and that utilization of multiple types of coping strategies is more supportive. This study amplifies the voice of military medical students concerning the importance of prioritizing self-care and available resources given the unique pressures and demands of their dual military medical curriculum.Copyright Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2023.

N2  - AIMS: To examine the relationships between challenges, coping and resilience among immigrant parents caring for their children with disabilities; and to explore their coping and resilient experiences and the service centre providers' perspectives on these. DESIGN: A sequential explanatory mixed methods study. METHOD(S): The participants were recruited from seven centres of disability service in Australia between May 2019 and February 2020. Phase 1 consisted of a cross-sectional survey. Data were collected from 134 immigrant parents. Phase 2 consisted of semi-structured interviews. Data were collected from nine immigrant parents and nine service providers. The findings from each phase were analysed separately and then integrated to answer the research aims. RESULT(S): Immigrant parents experienced challenges such as overwhelming caretaking responsibilities, lack of supportive social networks and feeling embarrassment over their children's behaviours. They used a variety of coping strategies, including reframing and mobilizing family to acquire and accept help from others to overcome their challenges. They had positive gains from the parental experience. Immigrant parents had a reasonable level of resilience. Those with a higher level of perceived challenges had a lower level of coping and resilience. Perceived barriers to parental coping included barriers to establishing social networks and utilizing available disability services. Services from competent service providers and the availability of social support networks were factors facilitating immigrant parents' coping. CONCLUSION(S): Sensitive communication and culturally appropriate care provided by service providers and healthcare professionals can facilitate service utilization and reduce perceived stigma over children with disability. IMPACT: Findings from the study support that special training provided to healthcare providers about the challenges of immigrant parents raising children with disabilities may enhance awareness of the experience of these parents. Information and instrumental support may help to enhance parental coping, reduce isolation and promote their mental health. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: We thank the immigrant parents and the service providers who have been instrumental in the conception of this study.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - U.S.-Mexico border residents experience pervasive social and ecological stressors that contribute to a high burden of chronic disease. However, the border region is primarily composed of high-density Mexican-origin neighborhoods, a characteristic that is most commonly health-promoting. Understanding factors that contribute to border stress and resilience is essential to informing the effective design of community-level health promotion strategies. La Vida en La Frontera is a mixed-methods, participatory study designed to understand factors that may contribute to border resilience in San Luis, Arizona. The study's initial qualitative phase included interviews with 30 Mexican-origin adults exploring community perceptions of the border environment, cross-border ties, and health-related concepts. Border residents described the border as a Mexican enclave characterized by individuals with a common language and shared cultural values and perspectives. Positive characteristics related to living in proximity to Mexico included close extended family relationships, access to Mexican food and products, and access to more affordable health care and other services. Based on these findings, we co-designed the 9-item Border Resilience Scale that measures agreement with the psychosocial benefits of these border attributes. Pilot data with 60 residents suggest there are positive sociocultural attributes associated with living in border communities. Further research should test if they mitigate environmental stressors and contribute to a health-promoting environment for residents.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

T1  - Substance use disorders: a comprehensive update of classification, epidemiology, neurobiology, clinical aspects, treatment and prevention
A1  - Volkow N.D.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Substance use disorders (SUDs) are highly prevalent and exact a large toll on individuals' health, well-being, and social functioning. Long-lasting changes in brain networks involved in reward, executive function, stress reactivity, mood, and self-awareness underlie the intense drive to consume substances and the inability to control this urge in a person who suffers from addiction (moderate or severe SUD). Biological (including genetics and developmental life stages) and social (including adverse childhood experiences) determinants of health are recognized factors that contribute to vulnerability for or resilience against developing a SUD. Consequently, prevention strategies that target social risk factors can improve outcomes and, when deployed in childhood and adolescence, can decrease the risk for these disorders. SUDs are treatable, and evidence of clinically significant benefit exists for medications (in opioid, nicotine and alcohol use disorders), behavioral therapies (in all SUDs), and neuromodulation (in nicotine use disorder). Treatment of SUDs should be considered within the context of a Chronic Care Model, with the intensity of intervention adjusted to the severity of the disorder and with the concomitant treatment of comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions. Involvement of health care providers in detection and management of SUDs, including referral of severe cases to specialized care, offers sustainable models of care that can be further expanded with the use of telehealth. Despite advances in our understanding and management of SUDs, individuals with these conditions continue to be stigmatized and, in some countries, incarcerated, highlighting the need to dismantle policies that perpetuate their criminalization and instead develop policies to ensure support and access to prevention and treatment.Copyright © 2023 World Psychiatric Association.

N2  - Objective: Compassion is widely regarded as an important component of high-quality healthcare. However, its conceptualization, use, and associated outcomes in the care of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) have not been synthesized. The aim of this review is to scope the peer reviewed academic literature on the conceptualization, use, and outcomes associated with compassion in the care of PwMS. Method(s): Studies were eligible for inclusion if reporting primary research data from quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods studies on the conceptualization, use, and outcomes associated with compassion in the care of PwMS. Relevant studies were identified through searching five electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) in January 2022. We followed the guidance outlined in the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) manual for evidence synthesis, and also referred to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews Checklist (PRISMA-ScR). Simple descriptive methods were used to chart quantitative findings, and a descriptive approach with basic content analysis was employed to describe qualitative findings. Result(s): Fifteen studies were included (participant n = 1722): eight quantitative, six mixed-methods, one exclusively qualitative. Synthesized qualitative data revealed that PwMS conceptualize compassion as involving self-kindness, agency, and acceptance. PwMS report using self-compassion in response to unpleasant sensations and experiences. Quantitative findings suggest that compassion may mediate benefit finding, reduced distress, and improved quality of life (QoL) in PwMS, that those with the condition may become more compassionate through time, and that self-compassion specifically can be increased through training in mindfulness. In this context, greater self-compassion in PwMS correlates with less depression and fatigue, better resilience and QoL. Among studies, self-compassion was the most common outcome measure for PwMS. Conclusion(s): A nascent literature exists on the conceptualization, use, and outcomes associated with compassion in the care of PwMS. Further research is required to better understand what compassion means to PwMS and those caring for them. However, self-compassion can be cultivated among PwMS and may be helpful for managing unpleasant somatic symptoms and in benefit finding. Impact on other health outcomes is less clear. The use of compassion by health care providers in the care of PwMS is unstudied.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Living with the experience of hearing voices without trying to ignore or suppress them is referred to as accepting auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). It varies depending on the phenomenology of AVH itself; some clients may find it challenging to acquire new coping mechanisms with the voices. AIM: Examine the association between the phenomenology of AVH and acceptance or autonomous action among clients with schizophrenia. DESIGN: A descriptive correlational study was conducted on 200 clients with schizophrenia using the following instruments; Sociodemographic and clinical data tools, Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS-AH), and Voices Acceptance and Action Scale (VAAS). RESULT(S): Most patients have moderate to severe levels of AVH (95.5 %), with a mean score of 25.34. The emotional characteristics reflected the high mean score (11.24). A highly statistically negative correlation was found between the total Voices Acceptance and Action Scale and severity of AVH (P = -0.448, sig = 0.000). A predictable significant effect of user acceptance and autonomous actions response coping with decreasing the severity of AVH was found (adjusted r square = 0.196, sig = 0.000) and model equation = Severity of Verbal auditory hallucinations = 31.990-0.257 X Total of Voice Acceptance and Autonomous Action Scale (VAAS). CONCLUSION(S): The severity of all phenomenological characteristics of AVH can be successfully reduced by using voice acceptance and autonomous action responses rather than resistance or engagement responses. Subsequently, it must be improved and learned by psychiatric nurses the patients with schizophrenia in the hospitals by applying Acceptance and Commitment Therapy as a crucial intervention.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BackgroundAlthough economic stability, social context, and healthcare access are well-known social determinants of health associated with more challenging recovery after traumatic injury, little is known about how these factors differ by mechanism of injury. Our team sought to use the results of social determinants of health screenings to better understand the population that engaged with psychosocial support services after traumatic musculoskeletal injury and fill a gap in our understanding of patient-reported social health needs.Question/purposeWhat is the relationship between social determinants of health and traumatic musculoskeletal injury?MethodsTrauma recovery services is a psychosocial support program at our institution that offers patients and their family members resources such as professional coaching, peer mentorship, post-traumatic stress disorder screening and treatment, educational resources, and more. This team engages with any patient admitted to, treated at, and released from our institution. Their primary engagement population is individuals with traumatic injury, although not exclusively. Between January 2019 and October 2021, the trauma recovery services team interacted with 6036 patients. Of those who engaged with this service, we considered only patients who experienced a traumatic musculoskeletal injury and had a completed social determinants of health screening tool. During the stated timeframe, 13% (814 of 6036) of patients engaged with trauma recovery services and had a complete social determinants of health screening tool. Of these, 53% (428 of 814) had no physical injury. A further 26% (99 of 386) were excluded because they did not have traumatic musculoskeletal injuries, leaving 4.8% (287) for analysis in this cross-sectional study. The study population included patients who interacted with trauma recovery services at our institution after a traumatic orthopaedic injury that occurred between January 2019 and October 2021. Social determinants of health risk screening questionnaires were self-administered prospectively using a screening tool developed by our institution based on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services social determinants of health screening questions. Mechanisms of injury were separated into intentional (physical assault, sexual assault, gunshot wound, or stabbing) and unintentional (fall, motor vehicle collision, or motorcycle crash). During the study period, 287 adult patients interacted with trauma recovery services after a traumatic musculoskeletal injury and had complete social determinant of health screening; 123 injuries were unintentional and 164 were intentional. Patients were primarily women (55% [159 of 287]), single (73% [209 of 287]), and insured by Medicaid or Medicare (78% [225 of 287]). Mechanism category was determined after a thorough medical record review to verify the appropriate category. An initial exploratory univariate analysis was completed for the primary outcome variable using the Pearson chi-squared test for categorical variables and a two-tailed independent t-test for continuous variables. All demographic variables and social determinants of health with p < 0.20 in the univariate analysis were included in a multivariate binary regression analysis to determine independent associations with injury mechanism. All variables with p < 0.05 in the multivariate analysis were considered statistically significant.ResultsAfter controlling for potential demographic confounders, younger age (odds ratio [OR] 0.93 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 0.96]; p < 0.001), Black race (compared with White race, OR 2.71 [95% CI 1.20 to 6.16]; p = 0.02), Hispanic ethnicity (compared with White race, OR 5.32 [95% CI 1.62 to 17.47]; p = 0.006), and at-risk status for food insecurity (OR 4.27 [95% CI 1.18 to 15.39]; p = 0.03) were independently associated with intentional mechanisms of injury.ConclusionThere is a relationship between the mechanism of traumatic orthopaedic injury and social determinants of health risks. Specifically, data showed a correlation between food insecurity and intentional injury. Healthcare systems and providers should be cognizant of this, as well as the additional challenges patients may face in their recovery journey because of social needs. Screening for needs is only the first step in addressing patient's social health needs. Healthcare systems should also allocate resources for personnel and programs that support patients in meeting their social health needs. Future studies should evaluate the impact of such programming in responding to social needs that impact health outcomes and improve health disparities.Level of EvidenceLevel IV, prognostic study.Copyright © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  - Background: Palliative medicine physicians may be at higher risk of burnout due to increased stressors and compromised resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout prevalence and factors influencing this among UK and Irish palliative medicine physicians is unknown. Aim(s): To determine the prevalence of burnout and the degree of resilience among UK and Irish palliative medicine physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated factors. Design(s): Online survey using validated assessment scales assessed burnout and resilience: The Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel [MBI-HSS (MP)] and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Additional tools assessed depressive symptoms, alcohol use, and quality of life. Setting/participants: Association of Palliative Medicine of UK and Ireland members actively practising in hospital, hospice or community settings. Result(s): There were 544 respondents from the 815 eligible participants (66.8%), 462 provided complete MBI-HSS (MP) data and were analysed. Of those 181/462 (39.2%) met burnout criteria, based on high emotional exhaustion or depersonalisation subscales of the MBI-HSS (MP). A reduced odds of burnout was observed among physicians who worked 20 h/week (vs 31-40 h/week, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.002-0.56) and who had a greater perceived level of clinical support (aOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62-0.80). Physicians with higher levels of depressive symptoms had higher odds of burnout (aOR 18.32, 95% CI 6.75-49.73). Resilience, mean (SD) CD-RISC score, was lower in physicians who met burnout criteria compared to those who did not (62.6 (11.1) vs 70.0 (11.3); p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Over one-third of palliative medicine physicians meet burnout criteria. The provision of enhanced organisational and colleague support is paramount in both the current and future pandemics.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Background: During a pandemic, tracheostomy management in neuromuscular disease (NMD) patients can be complex. Method(s): Using a multicentre, multiple case study approach, we sought perspectives through semi-structured interviews via hybrid quali-quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis involved a semi-structured interview and the quantitative analysis the completion of a battery of questionnaires. Aim(s): To investigate the caregivers' experiences, burden and beliefs regarding tracheostomy during the Italian COVID-19 pandemic. The following instruments were administered: Connor and Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-25); Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II); State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); Langer Mindfulness Scale (LMS); Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Result(s): Fifty-three caregivers (62.3% female, mean age 52.2 (SD = 18.2)) participated in the study. The more resilient the carers, the more they were psychologically flexible (r = 0.380, p = 0.014) and able to cope adaptively with the emergency (r = 0.378, p < 0.006). Similarly, perceived control was higher the more resilient they were (r = 0.897, p < 0.001). The main emotions emerging were isolation and loneliness (15; 34.88%). The perception of tracheostomy meant that it could be seen as a lifesaver or as a condemnation. Similarly, the relationship with health professionals moves from satisfaction to a feeling of abandonment over the course of the pandemic. Conclusion(s): These findings offer a unique opportunity to understand the point of view of caregivers of NMD patients living with tracheotomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, when going to the hospital may have been hampered.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Refugees are at an increased risk of developing symptoms of mental disorders but face various structural and socio-cultural barriers to accessing mental health care. The SPIRIT project (Scaling-up Psychological Interventions in Refugees In SwiTzerland) seeks to promote the resilience of refugees and improve their access to mental health care. For this purpose, Problem Management Plus (PM+), an evidence-based low-intensity psychological intervention delivered by trained non-specialist "helpers", is being scaled-up in Switzerland. OBJECTIVE(S): To identify factors influencing the process of the large-scale implementation of PM+for refugees in Switzerland and to develop recommendations to guide the implementation process. METHOD(S): 22 semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants (Syrian refugees who previously participated in PM+, PM+helpers, health professionals working with refugees and decision-makers from the migration, integration, social, and health sectors). The data were analyzed using thematic analysis, combining an inductive and deductive approach. RESULT(S): The data revealed three major themes, which might have an impact for the longer-term implementation of PM+in Switzerland. First, preconditions for successful integration in the health system prior to scaling-up such as sustainable funding or the introduction of a stepped care approach. Second, the requirements for the PM+intervention supporting scale-up such as quality control during PM+delivery, PM+modality, time and setting when PM+is offered or the views on task sharing. Third, the perceived benefits of scaling-up PM+in Switzerland. CONCLUSION(S): Our results have shown that PM+must be scaled-up within a stepped care approach, including a functioning triage system and sustainable funding. Rather than selecting one modality or setting, it seemed preferable to offer a variety of formats and settings to achieve maximum reach and benefits. A successful scale-up of PM+in Switzerland might have various benefits. Communicating them to policy-makers and health providers, might enhance their acceptability of the intervention and their willingness to adopt PM+in regulatory structure and promote it.Copyright © 2023.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Objectives: 1. Define the principle of mentorship. 2. Elucidate the benefits of mentorship on personal, professional, and career development. 3. Describe how to be an effective mentor. 4. Describe how to be an effective mentee. 5. Discuss helpful steps in building a nuclear medicine mentorship team. Method(s): 1. Review of the current literature regarding mentorship in medicine and business. 2. Reviewof the current literature regarding mentorship in nuclear medicine. 3. Comparison of the attributes of an effective mentor and mentee. 4. Presentation of high-yield steps in creating a nuclear medicine mentorship team. Result(s): 1. Individuals with mentors have greater job performance, higher salary, more promotions, greater job satisfaction, and less burnout. 2. Coaching and mentorship can lead to significant improvement in goal attainment, solution-focused thinking, self-insight, resilience, and psychopathology. 3. Mentorship can be personal, professional, clinical, academic, or research - oriented. 4. A mentoring team can offer diversity in experience, thought, perspective, and skill. Greater team diversity can increase potential. After identifying goals and creating a plan, developing a mentorship team involves circles of interactions with friends, colleagues, acquaintances, and individuals within and outside of nuclear medicine. 5. Effective mentees clarify their need, select the right people to help them, finish tasks ahead of schedule, are mindful of mentor's time, are energized and engaging, and credit others liberally. 6. Effective mentors provide guidance and coaching, help set and achieve goals, provide accountability, given honest feedback, and sponsor the mentee. 6. Developing a mentorship team can include personal networking at work and meetings; direct contact with potential mentors by phone, email or social media; committee involvement; and teaching. In nuclear medicine, this can include physicians, pharmacists, physicists, technologists, trainees, and students. Conclusion(s): Mentorship benefits the mentor and mentee. A mentorship team can improve personal and professional development, collaboration, job performance, and wellbeing.

N2  - Background: Health of the adolescents is an important determinant of adult health. Multiple factors may affect the adolescents' health. Aim(s): This exploratory cross-sectional study was to explore the effects of life stress, social support, and family hardiness on quality of life (QoL) in rural adolescents (15 to 19 years old) whose family had encountered adverse disaster events. Method(s): Purposive sampling was used to recruit 350 adolescents met study criteria with 265 completing all questionnaires (response rate = 75.71%). Based on stress process model, we hypothesized that life stress and social support would directly and indirectly influence QoL, and family hardiness mediates the effects of life stress on QoL. Path analysis was employed to analyze the association among life stress, social support, family hardiness, and QoL. Result(s): The study showed that life stress, social support and family hardiness are significantly associated with adolescents' QoL: life stress (beta = 0.30, P < 0.001), social support (beta = 0.18, P = 0.010), and family hardiness (beta = 0.21, P = 0.002). Life stress and social support had significant association with family hardiness: life stress (beta = 0.23, P = 0.001) and social support (beta = 0.29, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Life stress directly and indirectly influences QoL through family hardiness. Family hardiness can buffer the effects of life stress. Social support could improve the adolescents' QoL. To promote QoL, it is important for healthcare providers to attend rural adolescents' life stress, and provide psychosocial interventions to enhance family hardiness and social support.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

N2  - Objective: Prior clinical trials have shown consistent clinical benefit for Capnometry Guided Respiratory Intervention (CGRI), a prescription digital therapeutic for the treatment of panic disorder (PD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this study is to report real-world outcomes in a series of patients treated with the intervention in clinical practice. Design(s): This paper reports pre- and post-treatment self-reported symptom reduction, measures of respiratory rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels, drop-out and adherence rates drawn from an automatic data repository in a large real-world series of patients receiving CGRI for panic disorder and PTSD. Setting(s): Patients used the intervention in their homes, supported by telehealth coaching. Participant(s): Patients meeting symptom criteria for panic disorder (n = 1,395) or posttraumatic stress disorder (n = 174) were treated following assessment by a healthcare professional. Intervention(s): Capnometry Guided Respiratory Intervention is a 28-day home-based treatment that provides breath-to-breath feedback of respiratory rate and exhaled carbon dioxide levels, aimed at normalizing respiratory style and increasing patients' mastery for coping with symptoms of stress, anxiety, and panic. Health coaches provide initial training with weekly follow up during the treatment episode. Remote data upload and monitoring facilitates individualized coaching and aggregate outcomes analysis. Main Outcome Measure(s): Self-reported Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) scores were obtained at pre-treatment and post-treatment. Result(s): Panic disorder (PD) patients showed a mean pre-to-post-treatment reduction in total PDSS scores of 50.2% (P < 0.001, d = 1.31). Treatment response rates for PD (defined as a 40% or greater reduction in PDSS total scores) were observed in 65.3% of the PD patients. PTSD patients showed a pre-to-post-treatment reduction in total PCL-5 scores of 41.1% (P < 0.001, d = 1.16). The treatment response rate for PTSD (defined as a >=10-point reduction in PCL-5 scores) was 72.4%. In an additional analysis of response at the individual level, 55.7% of panic disorder patients and 53.5% of PTSD patients were classified as treatment responders using the Reliable Change Index. Patients with both normal and below-normal baseline exhaled CO2 levels experienced comparable benefit. Across the 28-day treatment period, mean adherence rates of 74.8% (PD) and 74.9% (PTSD) were recorded during the 28-day treatment. Dropout rates were 10% (PD) and 11% (PTSD) respectively. Conclusion(s): The results from this cohort of 1,569 patients treated with the CGRI intervention demonstrate significant rates of symptom reduction and adherence consistent with prior published clinical trials. The brief duration of treatment, high adherence rates, and clinical benefit suggests that CGRI provides an important addition to treatment options for panic disorder and PTSD.Copyright 2022 Cuyler, Katdare, Thomas and Telch.

N2  - Acne, atopic dermatitis (AD), and psoriasis are all chronic dermatologic conditions that greatly impact the lives of pediatric patients and their caregivers. The visible nature of these diseases negatively affects the self-image of children early in life as well as their relationships with their families and peers. Physicians recognize the importance of addressing both the physical and mental symptoms of their patients but are currently not equipped with clear guidelines to manage long-term psychosocial comorbidities in pediatric dermatologic patients. A PubMed and Google Scholar search of key words was conducted to explore self-image in pediatric patients with acne, AD, and psoriasis. Chronic skin diseases put pediatric patients at risk for strained family relationships, poor self-image, psychiatric comorbidities, stigmatization, and eventual suicidal behavior. A limitation of this study is a lack of a validated measure of quality of life in the pediatric population that fulfills enough criteria to evaluate long term quality of life in children and adults. Possible management options, including connecting patients with the same diagnosis and allocating resources to parents and teachers to better understand these chronic skin conditions, may provide pediatric patients with the support they need to develop resilience in the face of these challenges.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Introduction: Children of parents with mental disorders have a high chance of developing a mental disorder themselves. However, this at-risk group is regularly overlooked and typically not seen by any mental health professionals. Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) can provide a means of promoting mental health for children of parents with mental disorders. Objective(s): The introduced study will evaluate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the iCHIMPS IMI in promoting mental health for children of parents with mental disorders. Method(s): A two-armed multicentered cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) comparing the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the iCHIMPS IMI in the intervention group (IG) to a treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group will be conducted. Recruitment will be handled at currently 21 adult mental health clinics throughout Germany. Participating families will be randomly divided into the two groups until the final sample size of 306 participating adolescents (age 12-18) has been reached. The adolescents in the intervention group will receive access to the IMI and can take part in up to eight intervention modules. Assessment will be conducted during the recruitment (baseline), 1-month, 2-months, and 6-month post-inclusion. Primary outcome is the mental health of the participating adolescents at 6-months post-inclusion as measured by the Youth Self Report score. Secondary self-report outcomes are mental wellbeing, self-efficacy, coping strategies and negative effects as well as mental health of the adolescents as reported by their parent(s). Included moderators are sociodemographic characteristics, working alliance, social support and the mental health diagnoses of the parents. Statistical analyses will be conducted on the intention-to-treat principle as well as with additional per-protocol analyses. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness as well as qualitative data concerning the adherence, acceptance, and feasibility of the IMI will be analyzed. Discussion(s): The iCHIMPS cRCT examines the clinical- as well as cost-effectiveness of the iCHIMPS mental health promotion IMI for children of parents with mental disorders. This provides the opportunity to gain insights into an innovative as well as time- and location-independent form of support for this often-overlooked at-risk group. Additionally, the larger CHIMPS-NET project allows comparisons between internet-based and face-to-face interventions for a similar target group.

N2  - Aim: The climate and ecological crises are considered fundamental threats to human health. Healthcare workers in general and doctors in particular can contribute as change agents in mitigation and adaptation. Planetary health education (PHE) aims to harness this potential. This study explores perspectives among stakeholders involved in PHE at German medical schools on the characteristics of high-quality PHE and compares them to existing PHE frameworks. Method(s): In 2021, we conducted a qualitative interview study with stakeholders from German medical schools involved in PHE. Three different groups were eligible: faculty members, medical students actively involved in PHE, and study deans of medical schools. Recruitment was performed through national PHE networks and snowball sampling. Thematic qualitative text analysis according to Kuckartz was used for the analysis. Results were systematically compared to three existing PHE frameworks. Result(s): A total of 20 participants (13 female) from 15 different medical schools were interviewed. Participants covered a wide range of professional backgrounds and experience in PHE education. The analysis revealed ten key themes: (1) Complexity and systems thinking, (2) inter- and transdisciplinarity, (3) ethical dimension, (4) responsibility of health professionals, (5) transformative competencies including practical skills, (6) space for reflection and resilience building, (7) special role of students, (8) need for curricular integration, (9) innovative and proven didactic methods, and (10) education as a driver of innovation. Six of our themes showed substantial overlap with existing PHE frameworks. Two of our themes were only mentioned in one of the frameworks, and two others were not explicitly mentioned. Few important elements of the frameworks did not emerge from our data. Conclusion(s): In the light of increased attention regarding the connections of the climate and ecological crises and health, our results can be useful for anyone working toward the integration of planetary health into medical schools' and any health professions' curricula and should be considered when designing and implementing new educational activities.Copyright © 2023 Simon, Parisi, Wabnitz, Simmenroth and Schwienhorst-Stich.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the lack of a government contingency plan for an effective response to an unexpected health crisis. This study uses a phenomenological approach to explore the experience of healthcare professionals during the first three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in a public health hospital in the Valencia region, Spain. It assesses the impact on their health, coping strategies, institutional support, organizational changes, quality of care, and lessons learned. Method(s): We carried out a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews with doctors and nurses from the Preventive Medicine, Emergency, and Internal Medicine Services and the Intensive Care Unit, using the Colaizzi's 7-step data analysis method. Result(s): During the first wave, lack of information and leadership led to feelings of uncertainty, fear of infection, and transmission to family members. Continuous organizational changes and lack of material and human resources brought limited results. The lack of space to accommodate patients, along with insufficient training in treating critical patients, and the frequent moving around of healthcare workers, reduced the quality of care. Despite the high levels of emotional stress reported, no sick leave was taken; the high levels of commitment and professional vocation helped in adapting to the intense work rhythms. Healthcare professionals in the medical services and support units reported higher levels of stress, and a greater sense of neglect by their institution than their colleagues in managerial roles. Family, social support, and camaraderie at work were effective coping strategies. Health professionals showed a strong collective spirit and sense of solidarity. This helped them cope with the additional stress and workload that accompanied the pandemic. Conclusion(s): In the wake of this experience, they highlight the need for a contingency plan adapted to each organizational context. Such a plan should include psychological counseling and continuous training in critical patient care. Above all, it needs to take advantage of the hard-won knowledge born of the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2023 Rodriguez-Madrid, Pastor-Moreno, Albert-Lopez and Pastor-Valero.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Nursing is a demanding profession with constant stressors, which makes nurses vulnerable to the detrimental effects of high stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue. There is a need for a multidimensional group intervention facilitated by a licensed mental health professional to improve mental health and well-being in nurses. An intervention called RISE, which is an acronym for resilience, insight, self-compassion, and empowerment, was developed to promote self-care, protect against burnout, and improve indicators of well-being among nurses. We explain the rationale, theoretical framework, and development of RISE. METHOD(S): RISE is based on an integrative theoretical framework of mindfulness, acceptance and commitment therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. It consists of eight psychoeducational group sessions with topics related to the four RISE themes of resilience, insight, self-compassion, and empowerment. RESULT(S): RISE is a contribution to the literature on well-being interventions for nurses. It will further the understanding of effective interventions to mediate the detrimental effects of stress and burnout in nursing and to improve the mental health and well-being of nurses amid the complex interplay of factors at the individual, unit, and organizational levels. CONCLUSION(S): As an approach that combines education with therapeutic process and support to improve coping and well-being inside and outside of the workplace, RISE addresses the underlying causes and effects of high stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue.

N2  - Background/Aims The objective of this survey was to gather patients' perspectives on how stress triggered their inflammatory arthritis as well as exacerbates flares in their disease. Methods NRAS wanted to reach people living with RA and other forms of inflammatory arthritis via a national survey to gauge how they recognise and manage stress, and whether health professionals considered stress as a factor in their active disease. The survey was designed to capture demographics, impact of stress on patients' disease as well as work status and restrictions on lifestyle. The national online survey was distributed via all NRAS social media platforms as well as email. Results 1265 responses from across the UK were gathered. The majority of respondents were female (87.0%) and over the age of 55 years old (70.5%). Approximately 45% had a disease duration of more than 10 years, 30% between 4 and 10 years, and 23% less than 3 years. When asked on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (completely) how much stress had impacted the onset of their arthritis symptoms, 56% responded either 'completely' or 'greatly'. Only 9% reported that stress did not have an impact on the onset of their symptoms. When asked if they felt a stressful event in the 12 months prior to their diagnosis had triggered their inflammatory arthritis 28% said yes and 48% responded maybe. Some of the top reported causes of stress prior to diagnosis were: death of a close family member, menopause, work difficulties and family commitments. The majority of respondents (67%) said that health professionals did not ask them about stress during the diagnosis process, with only 11% saying this was discussed. Participants were asked how much they agreed with the statement that they are often asked about their mental health in routine appointments - 75% disagreed or strongly disagreed. Conclusion With the majority of respondents identifying that stress and stressful events exacerbate their symptoms of inflammatory arthritis, more should be done to measure and offer support for managing stress. While many had found their own ways of coping with stress more needs to be done to make support more easily accessible. Further research would be beneficial in identifying if managing stress within this patient population could significantly reduce inflammatory arthritis symptoms, reducing the distress and pain caused by flares and also reduce the impact on the health service of clinical intervention.

N2  - Background:Long-Term opioid therapy for chronic pain arose amid limited availability and awareness of other pain therapies. Although many complementary and integrative health (CIH) and nondrug therapies are effective for chronic pain, little is known about CIH/nondrug therapy use patterns among people prescribed opioid analgesics. Objective(s):The objective of this study was to estimate patterns and predictors of self-reported CIH/nondrug therapy use for chronic pain within a representative national sample of US military veterans prescribed long-Term opioids for chronic pain.Research Design:National two-stage stratified random sample survey combined with electronic medical record data. Data were analyzed using logistic regressions and latent class analysis.Subjects:US military veterans in Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care who received >=6 months of opioid analgesics.Measures:Self-reported use of each of 10 CIH/nondrug therapies to treat or cope with chronic pain in the past year: meditation/mindfulness, relaxation, psychotherapy, yoga, t'ai chi, aerobic exercise, stretching/strengthening, acupuncture, chiropractic, massage; Brief Pain Inventory-Interference (BPI-I) scale as a measure of pain-related function. Result(s):In total, 8891 (65%) of 13,660 invitees completed the questionnaire. Eighty percent of veterans reported past-year use of at least 1 nondrug therapy for pain. Younger age and female sex were associated with the use of most nondrug therapies. Higher pain interference was associated with lower use of exercise/movement therapies. Nondrug therapy use patterns reflected functional categories (psychological/behavioral, exercise/movement, manual). Conclusion(s):Use of CIH/nondrug therapies for pain was common among patients receiving long-Term opioids. Future analyses will examine nondrug therapy use in relation to pain and quality of life outcomes over time.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

T1  - The effect of cranial techniques on the heart rate variability response to psychological stress test in firefighter cadets

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is a simple tool to monitor cardiovascular stress. The proper function of the cardiovascular system is a problem among firefighters. Physical activity has health benefits correlated with psychological stress. Physically active people should be more resilient to psychological stress, but this has not always been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to determine whether cranial techniques would have an effect on HRV parameters. Osteopathy in the cranium reduces stress and improves cardiovascular function. Fifty-seven firefighter cadets aged 18-24 years (21.63+/-1.41) participated in the study. All subjects had their heart rate variability measured and were randomly assigned either to the cranial techniques (CS) group, with therapy performed once a week for 5 weeks), or to the control group (CO). After 5 weeks, heart rate variability was measured again in both groups. In the Friedman test, in the CS group there was a statistically significant effect of cranial techniques on Heart Rate (HR) and Low Frequency (LF), but not on High Frequency (HF); in the CO group, a statistically significant difference was observed for HR, HF and LF. In the Nemenyi test, in the CS group there was a statistically significant difference for HR and LF and in the CO group for HR, HF and LF. After applying hierarchical clustering with Euclidean measure and the complete method, dendrograms were drawn up showing similarities for HR, HF and LF values. The cranial techniques and touch might exert a beneficial effect on HRV. Both factors can be used in stressful situations to lower HRV.Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

N2  - The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and the factors associated with resilience among a sample of 118 Greek informal caregivers (78.8% females, mean age=58.9, SD=11.6) of people with dementia. Face-to-face interviews assessed caregivers' sociodemographics, resilience, quality of life, burden, familism, and perception of services and their proxy assessments of the cognitive functioning, functional activity, and behavioral problems of people with dementia. Moderate levels of resilience were reported by 58.6% of the caregivers. Dementia-related knowledge and higher levels of familism were associated with higher levels of resilience, whereas higher frequency of dealing with behavioral problems was associated with lower resilience. Effective interventions to strengthen Greek dementia caregivers' resilience should be culture-specific, targeting both behavioral problems and caregivers' intrapersonal facilitators (i.e, dementia-related knowledge) and interpersonal interactions (i.e., familism). Healthcare professionals may have a key role in building caregivers' resilience and contribute to implications for policy and practice.Copyright © 2022, Serdi.

N2  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions on psychological well-being, burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms among working registered nurses. BACKGROUND: Nurses account for nearly half of the global healthcare workforce and are considered significant contributors in multi-disciplinary healthcare teams. Yet, nurses face high levels of psychological distress, leading to burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder. Mindfulness-based training is a strategy that has been introduced to foster a state of awareness of present physical, emotional and cognitive experiences to regulate behaviour. DESIGN: This systematic review of randomised controlled trials was designed according to PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies were screened and extracted. Methodological quality was evaluated by two researchers, independently. RevMan 5.4 was used to conduct the meta-analysis. RESULT(S): Fourteen studies including a total of 1077 nurses were included, of which only eleven were included in the meta-analysis as the remaining had missing or incomplete data. Meta-analysis revealed that MBI was more effective than passive comparators in reducing psychological distress, stress, depression and burnout-personal accomplishment. When compared to active comparators, MBI was also found to be more effective in reducing psychological distress and was as effective in reducing stress, anxiety, depression and burnout. Evidence on the effects of MBIs on PTSD was scarce. CONCLUSION(S): Mindfulness-based interventions can effectively reduce psychological distress, stress, depression and some dimensions of burnout. However, evidence remains scarce in the literature. There is a need for more methodologically sound research on mindfulness-based training among nurses. RELEVANCE FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: An important aspect that relates to the success of mindfulness-based interventions is the continued and dedicated individual practice of the skills taught during mindfulness training amidst demanding clinical work environments. Therefore, relevant support for nurses must be accounted for in the planning, design and implementation of future mindfulness-based interventions.Copyright © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - The paper aims to show the multilevel and complex cooperation and the inclusion of the psychotherapist leading the psychotherapy in the medical team at the radiotherapy and clinical oncology clinic. We illustrate these interventions with the case of Stan. This 43-year-old firefighter was diagnosed with advanced head and neck cancer and pre-existing mental health problems meeting the criteria of ICD-10: obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and psychoactive substance abuse. During the treatment, suicidal thoughts and impulses emerged, triggered at the hospital by electronic noises and the feeling of entrapment without a way out. This situation put the patient at high risk and the whole healthcare team needed an urgent effective response. The patient agreed to stay in the secured room, where he was cared for by doctors, nurses, a dietitian, and a psychotherapist. He actively attended daily sessions with noticeable engagement. Psychotherapy sessions focused on alleviating posttraumatic stress disorder and OCD. Mindfulness and breathwork-based exercises were implemented to increase non-judgemental self-awareness and regulate the over-aroused nervous system. As a result, the patient's mental health has improved and the completion of the cancer treatment was possible. Psychotherapy, good therapeutic alliance, and attentive teamwork effectively managed his mental health and treatment-related symptoms.Copyright © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While the necessity for interventions to build resilient nurses in the COVID-19 pandemic is recognized, there is disagreement about the effective methods for achieving this. AIM: We present our research protocol that describes plans to design and test an interventional program for promoting nurses' resilience. DESIGN: This sequential exploratory interventional mixed-methods study is conducted in three phases (qualitative, intervention design, and quantitative). METHOD(S): It was funded from May 2021 for 24months. In phase 1, we explored strategies for promoting resilience in the COVID-19 pandemic from nurses' perspectives (through semi-structured interviews). In phase 2, we will design an interventional program for promoting nurses' resilience (using the qualitative phase and literature review results). We will assess the program's effectiveness on nurses' resilience in a randomized controlled trial in phase 3. DISCUSSION: Given the different experiences of nurses of resilience in COVID-19, our innovative program can guide future research to enhance nurses' resilience based on specific situations.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Introduction: Physician wellness has gained attention over recent years due to growing concerns regarding mental illness and burnout [1]. In addition to detrimental effects on physician well-being, burnout is associated with an increased risk of patient safety incidents [2]. Road to Mental Readiness (R2MR) military curriculum was developed to 'build awareness of mental illness and operational stress injuries through education with a goal to improving short-term performance and long-term health outcomes' [3]. Simulation Training for Resilience in Various Environments (STRIVE), an adaptation of R2MR, provides formal resiliency training to augment medical professional preparedness and positive adaptation in challenging clinical environments. Physicians-in-training have been identified as an at-risk population for burnout [4]. We propose that formal STRIVE training may improve self-reported resilience in physicians-in-training. This pilot study assesses STRIVE course delivery to junior residents by evaluating recruitment rates, course attendance and compliance with follow-up surveys. Method(s): Institutional research ethics board approval (REB 118769) was obtained. This is a single-centre randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio between the intervention (STRIVE) and control groups. Participants for this pilot study were a convenience sample of first- and second-year residents from our institution's anesthesia and emergency medicine residency programs. Consented participants were randomized using REDCAP sequence generation. Participants randomized to STRIVE received a 4-hour interactive workshop on personal mental wellness strategies followed by high-fidelity simulations to reinforce and apply learned techniques. Participants randomized to the control group received information regarding available resilience resources for self-study, as per usual departmental process. Study design and intervention details were concealed from control group participants to minimize subject bias. Self-reported resilience was quantified using the validated Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD RISC-10). Scores range from 0-40 with higher scores indicating greater perceived resilience [5]. Anonymous surveys were electronically distributed to all participants prior to the course delivery (baseline) and at 3-months postintervention. Resilience scores at 3-months were compared between groups using an ANCOVA model with baseline scores from respective groups used as a co-variate. Data are presented as mean (interquartile range [IQR]). A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): A total of 20 residents were consented from 24 potential participants, fulfilling the pilot study primary outcome metric (recruitment of >= 80% of eligible participants). The STRIVE course was completed by all participants randomized to the intervention group (n=10). Follow-up surveys were completed by 90% of the STRIVE group and 80% of the control group. Baseline resilience scores between groups were very similar (STRIVE: 28.1 [26.5-30]; control: 28.9 [26.5-33], Reported resilience scores 3-months post-intervention increased in the STRIVE group (31.1 [27-33.5]) and decreased in the control group (27.4 [22.8-33]). After adjustment for baseline resilience scores, there was a statistically insignificant difference in 3-month resilience scores between the groups (p=0.093). In the post-intervention survey, all STRIVE participants reported that skills learned during the STRIVE course had positively contributed to coping strategies employed during stressful clinical situations. Discussion(s): This study demonstrates feasibility of STRIVE course delivery and evaluation in junior anesthesia and emergency medicine residents. Participant recruitment, course and survey completion fulfilled preestablished feasibility metrics indicating a high level of engagement in formal resident resilience training. Preliminary results evaluating the effect of formal training on self-reported resilience suggest a potential positive effect of STRIVE course delivery. An appropriately powered, full-scale randomized controlled trial with participation of other postgraduate specialty programs is planned.

N2  - BackgroundPsychological distress can negatively influence disability, quality of life, and treatment outcomes for individuals with hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA). Clinical practice guidelines recommend a comprehensive disease management approach to OA that includes the identification, evaluation, and management of psychological distress. However, uncertainty around the best psychological screening and assessment methods, a poor understanding of the heterogeneity of psychological distress in those with OA, and lack of guidance on how to scale treatment have limited the growth of OA care models that effectively address individual psychological needs.Questions/purposes(1) Across which general and pain-related psychological distress constructs do individuals seeking conservative care for hip or knee OA report higher scores than the general population of individuals seeking conservative care for musculoskeletal pain conditions? (2) What common psychological phenotypes exist among nonsurgical care-seeking individuals with hip or knee OA?MethodsThe sample included participants from the Duke Joint Health Program (n = 1239), a comprehensive hip and knee OA care program, and the Optimal Screening for Prediction of Referral and Outcome (OSPRO) cohort studies (n = 871) comprising individuals seeking conservative care for knee, shoulder, low back, or neck pain. At the initial evaluation, patients completed the OSPRO Yellow Flag (OSPRO-YF) Assessment Tool, which assesses 11 general and pain-related psychological distress constructs (depression, anxiety, fear of movement, self-efficacy for managing one's own pain). We used OSPRO-YF scores to compare levels of psychological distress between the cohorts. Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated to determine the magnitude of differences between the groups, with d = 0.20, d = 0.50, and d = 0.80 indicating small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively. We used a latent class analysis to derive psychological distress phenotypes in people with OA based on the 11 OSPRO-YF psychological distress indicators. Psychological distress phenotypes are characterized by specific mood, belief, and behavioral factors that differentiate subgroups within a population. Phenotyping can help providers develop scalable treatment pathways that are better tailored to the common needs of patients.ResultsPatients with OA demonstrated higher levels of general and pain-related psychological distress across all psychological constructs except for trait anxiety (that is, anxiety level as a personal characteristic rather than as a response to a stressful situation, like surgery) with small-to-moderate effect sizes. Characteristics with the largest effect sizes in the OA and overall OSPRO cohort were (Cohen's d) general anxiety (-0.66, lower in the OA cohort), pain catastrophizing (the tendency to ruminate over, maginfiy, or feel helpless about a pain experience, 0.47), kinesiophobia (pain-related fear of movement, 0.46), pain self-efficacy (confidence in one's own ability to manage his or her pain, -0.46, lower in the OA cohort), and self-efficacy for rehabilitation (confidence in one's own ability to perform their rehabilitation treatments, -0.44, lower in the OA cohort). The latent class analysis yielded four phenotypes (% sample): high distress (52%, 647 of 1239), low distress (26%, 322 of 1239), low self-efficacy and acceptance (low confidence in managing and willingness to accept pain) (15%, 186 of 1239), and negative pain coping (exhibiting poor pain coping skills) (7%, 84 of 1239). The classification error rate was near zero (2%), and the median of posterior probabilities used to assign subgroup membership was 0.99 (interquartile range 0.98 to 1.00), both indicating excellent model performance. The high-distress group had the lowest mean age (61 +/- 11 years) and highest levels of pain intensity (6 +/- 2) and disability (HOOS JR: 50 +/- 15; KOOS JR: 47 +/- 15), whereas the low-distress group had the highest mean age (63 +/- 10 years) and lowest levels of pain (4 +/- 2) and disability (HOOS JR: 63 +/- 15; KOOS JR: 60 +/- 12). However, none of these differences met or exceeded anchor-based minimal clinically important difference thresholds.ConclusionsGeneral and pain-related psychological distress are common among individuals seeking comprehensive care for hip or knee OA. Predominant existing OA care models that focus on biomedical interventions, such as corticosteroid injection or joint replacement that are designed to directly address underlying joint pathology and inflammation, may be inadequate to fully meet the care-related needs of many patients with OA due to their underlying psychological distress. We believe this because biomedical interventions do not often address psychological characteristics, which are known to influence OA-related pain and disability independent of joint pathology. Healthcare providers can develop new comprehensive hip and knee OA treatment pathways tailored to these phenotypes where services such as pain coping skills training, relaxation training, and psychological therapies are delivered to patients who exhibit phenotypes characterized by high distress or negative pain coping. Future studies should evaluate whether tailoring treatment to specific psychological phenotypes yields better clinical outcomes than nontailored treatments, or treatments that have a more biomedical focus.Level of EvidenceLevel III, diagnostic study.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  - Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented burnout in frontline health care providers. However, the impact of the pandemic on interfacility pediatric and neonatal transport team members has not been studied. The current study uses a survey design to document the impact of the pandemic on pediatric and neonatal transport team members with a focus on staffing and resilience promotion strategies. Method(s): Data for this study came from a short cross-sectional survey distributed to members of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Transport Medicine. Result(s): Sixty-six teams responded (around 45%). Forty-one respondents (62%) reported vacancies on their transport teams, with 35 (53.8%) reporting more vacancies during the pandemic. Forty percent of highly trained registered nurses and respiratory therapists from specialty teams left their positions for those with better compensation during the pandemic. Forty-two percent of respondents were not trained to recognize burnout, stress, or compassion fatigue. Conclusion(s): Our study shows that half of the respondents had more vacancies during the pandemic than in previous years and reported difficulty in filling those positions. We were unable to link the vacancies to the pandemic and burnout because hospitalizations and transports in the pediatric facilities decreased during the pandemic; however, we do report that coronavirus disease 2019 exposure before the vaccine was a source of stress for team members. There are opportunities to improve the identification of burnout and to foster resilience and boost retention of this highly skilled niche workforce.Copyright © 2023 Air Medical Journal Associates

N2  - BACKGROUND: Up to one third of all stroke patients suffer from one or more psychosocial impairments. Recognition and treatment of these impairments are essential in improving psychosocial well-being after stroke. Although nurses are ideally positioned to address psychosocial well-being, they often feel insecure about providing the needed psychosocial care. Therefore, we expect that providing nurses with better knowledge to deliver this care could lead to an improvement in psychosocial well-being after stroke. Currently it is not known which interventions are effective and what aspects of these interventions are most effective to improve psychosocial well-being after stroke. OBJECTIVE(S): To identify potentially effective interventions - and intervention components - which can be delivered by nurses to improve patients' psychosocial well-being after stroke. METHOD(S): A systematic review and data synthesis of randomized controlled trials and quasi experimental studies was conducted. Papers were included according to the following criteria: 1) before-after design, 2) all types of stroke patients, 3) interventions that can be delivered by nurses, 4) the primary outcome(s) were psychosocial. PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Cochrane library were searched (August 2019-April 2022). Articles were selected based on title, abstract, full text and quality. Quality was assessed by using Joanna Briggs Institute checklists and a standardized data extraction form developed by Joanna Brigss Institute was used to extract the data. RESULT(S): In total 60 studies were included, of which 52 randomized controlled trials, three non-randomized controlled trials, four quasi-experimental studies, and one randomized cross-over study. Nineteen studies had a clear psychosocial content, twenty-nine a partly psychosocial content, and twelve no psychosocial content. Thirty-nine interventions that showed positive effects on psychosocial well-being after stroke were identified. Effective intervention topics were found to be mood, recovery, coping, emotions, consequences/problems after stroke, values and needs, risk factors and secondary prevention, self-management, and medication management. Active information and physical exercise were identified as effective methods of delivery. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that interventions to improve psychosocial well-being should include the intervention topics and methods of delivery that were identified as effective. Since effectiveness of the intervention can depend on the interaction of intervention components, these interactions should be studied. Nurses and patients should be involved in the development of such interventions to ensure it can be used by nurses and will help improve patients' psychosocial well-being.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Emergency nurses are vulnerable to violence, because they closely face patients or caregivers in emergency situations, where tension and conflicts are heightened. This is known to increase their turnover intentions. This study aimed to analyze the effects of emergency nurses' experiences of violence, resilience, and nursing work environment on turnover intentions. METHOD(S): This descriptive study analyzed a questionnaire administered to emergency nurses from March 2020 to April 2020. Its participants included 100 emergency nurses from 4 emergency medical centers. The collected data were analyzed using the SPSS/WIN 25.0 program (IBM SPSS Statistics) by frequency, percentage, mean, SD, t test, analysis of variance, and multiple regression RESULTS: The main factors affecting the turnover intentions of emergency nurses were resilience (beta = -0.32, P = .003), frequency of violence by patients (beta = 0.27, P = .003), and nursing managers' leadership and support for nurses (beta = -0.25, P = .021). The explanatory power of these 3 variables was 29.3%. DISCUSSION: To reduce emergency nurses' turnover intentions, it may be necessary to conduct resilience programs for them. In addition, safety measures to prevent violence at the organizational level and improve nursing managers' abilities, leadership, and support for nurses can reduce nurses' intention to leave.Copyright © 2022.

N2  - Phenomenon: The Coping Reservoir Model is a useful theoretical and analytical framework through which to examine student resilience and burnout. This model conceptualizes wellbeing as a reservoir which is filled or drained through students' adaptive and maladaptive coping mechanisms. This dynamic process has the capacity to foster resilience and reduce burnout or the inverse. This study aimed to explore health profession students' coping mechanisms and their experiences of resilience and burnout during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Approach: Employing the Coping Reservoir Model, qualitative focus groups involving health profession students enrolled at Qatar University were conducted, in October 2020, to solicit their lived experiences of stress and burnout during the pandemic. The Coping Reservoir Model was used to structure the topic guide for the focus group discussion and the Framework Analysis Approach was used in the data analysis. Finding(s): A total of 43 participants comprised eight focus groups. Health profession students encountered myriad personal, social, and academic challenges during the pandemic which adversely impacted their wellbeing and their capacity for coping. In particular, students reported high levels of stress, internal conflict, and heavy demands on their time and energy. The shift to online learning and uncertainty associated with adapting to online learning and new modes of assessment were exacerbating factors. Students sought to replenish their coping reservoir through engagement in a range of intellectual, social, and health-promoting activities and seeking psychosocial support in their efforts to mitigate these stressors. Insights: Students in this region have traditionally been left to their own devices to deal with stress and burnout during their academic training, wherein the institutions focus exclusively on the delivery of information. This study underscores student needs and potential avenues that health profession educators might implement to better support their students, for instance the development and inclusion of longitudinal wellbeing and mentorship curricula geared to build resilience and reduce burnout. The invaluable contributions of health professionals during the pandemic warrant emphasis, as does an examination of the stress associated with these roles to normalize and justify inclusion of wellbeing and resilience modules within the curriculum. Actively engaging health profession students in university-led volunteer activities during public health crises and campaigns would provide opportunities to replenish their coping reservoirs through social engagement, intellectual stimulation, and consolidating their future professional identities.

N2  - Objectives To examine the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of mental health professionals (MHPs) in the Netherlands and understand their needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design and setting A cross-sectional, mixed-methods study was conducted with MHPs from the Netherlands from June 2020 to October 2020, consisting of an online survey and three online focus group discussions. Participants Participants were MHPs from various occupational groups (psychologists, social workers, mental health nurses, developmental education workers, etc). Primary and secondary outcome measures The online survey included questions about work-related changes due to COVID-19 perceived resilience to stress, changes in lifestyle behaviours and mental health symptoms. The focus group discussions focused mostly on work experiences during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results MHP's reported an increase in experience workload during the pandemic (mean score 8.04 based on a scale of 1-10) compared to before the pandemic (mean score of 7). During the first wave of the pandemic, 50% of respondents reported increased stress, 32% increased sleeping problems and 24% increased mental health problems. Adverse occupational (eg, increased workload OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.28-2.32), psychological (eg, life satisfaction OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75), lifestyle (eg, increased sleep problems OR 2.80, 95% CI 2.07-3.80) and physical factors (decline in physical health OR 3.56, 95% CI 2.61-4.85) were associated with a decline in mental health. Participants expressed significant concern in the focus group discussions about the duration of the pandemic, the high workload, less work-life balance and lack of contact with colleagues. Suggestions to improve working conditions included ensuring clear communication about guidelines and facilitating worker contact and support via peer-to-peer coaching where experiences can be shared. Conclusions The current study indicates that MHP experienced a decline in mental health status during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which should be taken into consideration by employers, policymakers and researchers.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023

N2  - BACKGOUND: Nurses working in care homes face significant challenges that are unique to that context. The importance of effective resilience building interventions as a strategy to enable recovery and growth in these times of uncertainty have been advocated. The aim of this rapid review was to inform the development of a resource to support the resilience of care home nurses. We explored existing empirical evidence as to the efficacy of resilience building interventions. undertaken with nurses. METHOD(S): We undertook a rapid review using quantitative studies published in peer reviewed journals that reported resilience scores using a valid and reliable scale before and after an intervention aimed at supporting nurse resilience. The databases; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medline and PsychInfo. and the Cochrane Library were searched. The searches were restricted to studies published between January 2011 and October 2021 in the English language. Only studies that reported using a validated tool to measure resilience before and after the interventions were included. RESULT(S): Fifteen studies were included in this rapid review with over half of the studies taking place in the USA. No studies reported on an intervention to support resilience with care home nurses. The interventions focused primarily on hospital-based nurses in general and specialist contexts. The interventions varied in duration content and mode of delivery, with interventions incorporating mindfulness techniques, cognitive reframing and holistic approaches to building and sustaining resilience. Thirteen of the fifteen studies selected demonstrated an increase in resilience scores as measured by validated and reliable scales. Those studies incorporating 'on the job,' easily accessible practices that promote self-awareness and increase sense of control reported significant differences in pre and post intervention resilience scores. CONCLUSION(S): Nurses continue to face significant challenges, their capacity to face these challenges can be nurtured through interventions focused on strengthening individual resources. The content, duration, and mode of delivery of interventions to support resilience should be tailored through co-design processes to ensure they are both meaningful and responsive to differing contexts and populations.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - ABSTRACT: In 2018, more than 67,000 people died because of drug overdoses, and of that number, approximately 69.5% involved an opioid, making it a leading cause of death in the United States. Additionally concerning is that 40 states have reported increased overdose deaths and opioid-related deaths since the start of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Presently, many insurance companies and healthcare providers require patients to receive counseling during medication treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), despite the lack of evidence that it is necessary for all patients. To inform policy and improve quality of treatment, this nonexperimental, correlational study examined the relationship between individual counseling status and treatment outcomes in patients receiving medication treatment for OUD. Treatment outcome variables (treatment utilization, medication use, and opioid use) were extracted from the electronic health records of 669 adults who received treatment between January 2016 and January 2018. Study findings suggest women in our sample were more likely to test positive for benzodiazepines (t = -4.3, p < .001) and amphetamines (t = -4.4, p < .001), whereas men used alcohol at higher rates than women (t = 2.2, p = .026). In addition, women were more likely to report having experienced Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder/trauma (chi2 = 16.5, p < .001) and anxiety (chi2 = 9.4, p = .002). Regression analyses revealed concurrent counseling was unrelated to medication utilization and ongoing opioid use. Patients who had prior counseling utilized buprenorphine more frequently (beta = 0.13, p < .001) and used opioids less often (beta = -0.14, p < .001); however, both relationships were weak. These data do not provide evidence that counseling during OUD outpatient has a significant impact on treatment outcomes. These findings provide further evidence that barriers to medication treatment such as mandatory counseling can and should be removed.Copyright © 2022 International Nurses Society on Addictions.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Circular economy is a model of economic, social and environmental production and consumption, aimed to build a sustainable society in tune with the available resources. In the Brundtland Report, (1987, United Nations) sustainability it is defined as an approach focused on "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." The European Medical Association (EMA), that has currently more than 50 000 members, is involved in the advancement of health, pursuing educational and professional goals addressed to the quality of environment, lifestyle and civil society through a circular medicine approach. This is a comprehensive strategy, integrating best medical practice, bioinformatics and molecular biology with economy, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Circular Medicine is the resilient framework linking all these topics with circular economy methods. Innovative possibilities of circular medicine are many: it is a comprehensive paradigm shift, countering a non-medicine based on simplistic algorithms with guidelines of insufficient effectiveness, reliability and generalizability, often passed off as innovative Artificial-Intelligence approaches. We launched in 2020 a still ongoing survey aimed at the dissemination of information and at a greater sensitivity of all our members and followers on these topics, striving to build circular medicine in the real-world. This position document is based on its preliminary results: 1. Studying and investigating the links among health, climate change, biodiversity, circular economy, robust Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning support are goals and needed practice suitable to be pursued by EMA and other medical and scientific associations. Circular economy will be fruitfully used in health facilities, including hospitals, with health professionals and life science researchers acting also in the role of influencers and opinion leaders. 2. The interventions based on epidemiology, environmental sciences, best practice in medicine, sustainable technologies and molecular biology, the pillars of a potential framework of circular medicine, need a robust bioinformatics and Artificial Intelligence support. 3. Academic curricula and health professionals CME courses should provide stronger digital knowledge, reliable procedures trainings and expertise along these lines. Daily routine of clinical observation and participatory dialogue are key elements for the progress toward a culture, practice and accomplishments of circular economy and medicine. 4. Molecular biology, still the most innovative field of medical and life science, has a role for strengthening the pathways of the circular economy, as a reliable and resilient basis of "circular medicine." 5. The lessons of COVID19, the ongoing battles for healthier lifestyles dealing with nutrition, exercise and against alcohol and cigarette smoking, and the concept of smart cities are some of the cornerstones of the proposed strategy for a real-world circular medicine. Debunking interventions against the misuse of scientific and medical are means for the development of circular economy and medicine. Effective roadmaps, guidelines and grids for recognizing and counteracting the overlap of bullying, imposter's fear, insufficient expertise and knowledge, fake assertions and evaluations are actively developed by EMA's ad-hoc workshops. AI knowledge and skills should be implemented within innovative molecular biology and medical best-practice academic-CME curricula.Copyright © 2023 The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Burnout is a pervasive issue in healthcare, with urology trainees reporting burnout rates as high as 63.8%. Resilience training is a proven tool to prevent burnout and improve performance in high stress working environments, with demonstrated efficacy in surgical residency programs. Enhanced Stress Resilience Training (ESRT) is a mindfulness-based cognitive skills training developed and validated by Dr. Carter Lebares and the UCSF Center for Mindfulness in Surgery. ESRT offers tools to reframe thoughts and promote emotional regulation. The primary goal of this study is to assess feasibility and to introduce a curriculum to expand a pre-existing program focused on wellness and individual skill development. METHOD(S): Through consultation with Dr. Lebares, we customized course structure to include a didactics presentation and five ESRT sessions taught over Zoom by a certified ESRT instructor, a retired surgeon. We conducted the sessions in place of standard departmental conferences to mitigate personal time used for the training. Baseline descriptive pre and post course data was collected using validated surveys, including the Mental Health Continuum Short Form, Physician Wellbeing Index, and the Connor Davidson Resilience Index, with a subsequent focus group to gain qualitative data on overall course perception. Using two-sample t-tests, we compared differences between and pre and post course responses. RESULT(S): There were 33 participants in the course, with 20 residents, 7 faculty, and 6 others (student/APP). Surveys were completed by 30 participants pre course and 15 participants post course, with 15 sets of paired data. There were no statistically significant differences in self-reported wellbeing or stress response after course participation; however, participants were significantly more likely to use meditation as a stress coping mechanism after the course (p =0.008). Qualitative descriptive results demonstrated a 15% increase in participants' understanding of the impact mindfulness practices have on work performance. CONCLUSION(S): Our program successfully implemented ESRT via a novel remote delivery format. Although our analysis was limited by small sample size, our pilot study highlights feasibility in implementation. This curriculum also showed resident skill development in stress regulation through mindfulness practices. Next steps would include repeat delivery within the program to promote durability, and possible expansion beyond our single program.

T1  - The evaluation of a burnout workshop for community nurses
A1  - Schaufeli W.B. 
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - This study evaluates the effects of a burnout workshop that was conducted for community nurses (N = 64). The workshop included relaxation training, didactic and cognitive stress management, interpersonal skills training, and the enhancement of a more realistic professional role. The nurses' symptom levels (i.e., emotional exhaustion, tedium, psychological strain, and somatic complaints decreased significantly. However no significant changes were observed in the attitudinal component of burnout: the nurses' negative attitudes toward their recipients (depersonalization) and toward their performance on the job (reduced personal accomplishment) did not decrease. In addition, personality (i.e., the nurses' level of reactivity) played a moderating role: low reactive nurses who, by definition, are rather resistant to stress benefited more from the workshop than did high reactive nurses who are less resistant to stress. Since no control group was included, the results of this study are tentative and should be confirmed by future research.

N2  - Few studies have investigated the effects of the pandemic caused by COVID-19 on health professionals, especially nurses, from the point of view of the protective factors of mental health. The aim of this study was to assess the level of resilience in healthcare workers, to determine whether there were differences between two moments of the pandemic. Applying a longitudinal study, participants (N=590) from healthcare workers completed surveys in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the second wave. Socio-demographic and psychosocial variables such as resilience, emotional intelligence, optimism, self-efficacy, anxiety, and depression are used. There were differences between the two waves in all protective and risk variables except anxiety. In the first wave, there were three socio-demographic and psychosocial variables that explained 67.1% of the variance in resilience. In the first wave, three sociodemographic and psychosocial variables explained 67.1% of the variance in resilience in healthcare professionals. The enhancement of specific protective variables in healthcare professionals exposed to situations of high emotional stress can minimise the negative impact of the situation and promote more resilient responses in this professional group as a result.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - Objective: People who experience marginalization, including Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Plus (ie, all other marginalized genders and sexual orientations) people (LGBTQ+) experience discrimination during healthcare interactions, which negatively impacts patient-provider communication and care. Yet, scarce research examines the lived experience of unfair treatment among patients from marginalized groups to guide patient-centered tools that improve healthcare equity. Material(s) and Method(s): We interviewed 25 BIPOC and/or LGBTQ+ people about their experiences of unfair treatment and discrimination when visiting healthcare providers. Through thematic analysis, we describe participants' immediate reactions and longer-term consequences of those experiences. Result(s): We identified 4 ways that participants reacted to discrimination in the moment: Fighting, Fleeing, Excusing, and Working Around Bias. Long-term consequences reflect 6 ways they coped: Delaying or Avoiding Care, Changing Healthcare Providers, Self-prescribing, Covering Behaviors, Experiencing Health Complications, and Mistrusting Healthcare Institutions. Discussion(s): By describing how patients react to experiences of unfair treatment and discrimination, our findings enhance the understanding of health disparities as patients cope and struggle to speak out. To combat these problems, we identify 3 future directions for informatics interventions that improve provider behavior, support patient advocacy, and address power dynamics in healthcare. Conclusion(s): BIPOC and LGBTQ+ patients' perspectives on navigating unfair treatment and discrimination in healthcare offers critical insight into their experiences and long-term consequences of those experiences. Understanding the circumstances and consequences of unfair treatment, discrimination, and the impact of bias through this patient-centered lens is crucial to inform informatics technologies that promote health equity.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

N2  - Introduction: Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) is Australia's leading infectious and preventable cause of childhood disability. We investigated the lived experience of women with suspected CMV infection during pregnancy. Method(s): Women who had a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of CMV infection during pregnancy were eligible for the study. Participants were recruited via social media and consumer networks to participate in semi-structured interviews. Participants were purposively selected to capture a range of perinatal outcomes. Interview transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis. Result(s): Twelve participants were interviewed: 7 had a live birth, 4 had terminations of pregnancy and 1 had a neonatal death. Women reported a personal lack of CMV awareness prior to diagnosis. They often felt unsupported while making pregnancy related decisions due to uncertain prognostic information and low confidence in health care provider's CMV knowledge. The pregnancy and postpartum periods were characterized by uncertainty and anxiety about fetal/newborn health and long-term impacts of CMV. Communication around termination of pregnancy by health professionals was not always handled sensitively. Women supported screening for CMV, decision making and reproductive choice, but acknowledged that routine testing may not be wanted by everyone, may increase stress and terminations of pregnancy. Important coping strategies included counselling, partner support, medical expert consultations and gaining knowledge about CMV. Conclusion(s): Women with suspected CMV infection in pregnancy experienced uncertainty, anxiety and stress, which were exacerbated by poor health care professional knowledge and lack of consumer information. Our participants prioritized raising CMV awareness among pregnant women, medical practitioners and the general community.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nurses face many ethical challenges, placing them at risk for moral distress and burnout and challenging their ability to provide safe, high-quality patient care. Little is known about the sustainability of interventions to address this problem. OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the long-term impact on acute care nurses of a 6-session experiential educational program called the Mindful Ethical Practice and Resilience Academy (MEPRA). METHOD(S): MEPRA includes facilitated discussion, role play, guided mindfulness and reflective practices, case studies, and high-fidelity simulation training to improve nurses' skills in mindfulness, resilience, and competence in confronting ethical challenges. A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted on the impact of the MEPRA curriculum at 2 hospitals in a large academic medical system. The study involved surveys of 245 nurses at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 3 and 6 months after the intervention. RESULT(S): The results of the intervention were generally sustained for months afterward. The most robust improvements were in ethical confidence, moral competence, resilience, work engagement, mindfulness, emotional exhaustion, depression, and anger. Some outcomes were not improved immediately after the intervention but were significantly improved at 3 months, including anxiety and empathy. Depersonalization and turnover intentions were initially reduced, but these improvements were not sustained at 6 months. CONCLUSION(S): Many MEPRA results were sustained at 3 and 6 months after conclusion of the initial foundational program. Some outcomes such as depersonalization and turnover intentions may benefit from boosters of the intervention or efforts to supplement the training by making organizational changes to the work environment.Copyright ©2023 American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.

T1  - WHAT CAN I DO THE CHALLENGE OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION ONLINE
T3  - Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, CROI 2023. Seattle, WA United States.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Concerns about misinformation are not new, but the rise of social media has supercharged the risks of misinformation to the populace, especially when that misinformation deals with vaccination and communicable disease?. Studies have documented the prevalence of online misinformation on a range of topics and platforms. Social media features like fierce competition for audience attention, the potential for online echo chambers, and the prominent role of influencers explain the success of online misinformation. Journalism and health organizations contribute to the problem when they do not follow best practices for communicating scientific consensus and addressing uncertainty in health recommendations. However, understanding the impact of such misinformation is further complicated by recognizing that prevalence of misinformation does not equate to exposure. As a result, scholars and practioners have turned their attention to identifying best practices for addressing misinformation and reducing its spread. Three strategies for responding to the challenge of misinformation hold the most promise. First, prebunking misinformation involves giving people the tools to build resilience against misinformation before it spreads. This can happen by inoculating people against common misinformation strategies, educating the public with news and health literacy skills, and rebuilding trust in expert institutions tasked with conveying accurate information to the public. Second, debunking misinformation requires directly responding to and offering corrective information to concrete cases of viral misinformation. Third, promoting high quality information ensures that the public can easily find and identify the information they need, filling potential information voids and avoiding overload. Such high quality information must come from a variety of trusted sources to ensure its success in reaching the diverse audiences. Given the scope and speed with which misinformation can spread on social media, no one strategy will be sufficient to mitigate its potential harms to the public. Instead, we must build layers of resilience to misinformation by promoting high quality information, prebunking misinformation when it is likely to spread, and debunking misinformation after it has gone viral. This response requires concerted efforts from experts, journalists, platforms, and users alike, and each has a role to play.

N2  - Experiences of adversity can generate positive psychological effects alongside negative impacts. Little research to date has evaluated predictors of post-traumatic growth in mental or community healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following a survey of 854 community and mental healthcare staff in the United Kingdom in July to September 2020, multiple linear regression was used to determine the association between hypothesised risk and protective factors (personal, organisational and environmental variables) and total scores on the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory-Short Version. Positive self-reflection activities, black and minority ethnic status, developing new healthcare knowledge and skills, connecting with friends and family, feeling supported by senior management, feeling supported by the UK people, and anxiety about the personal and work-related consequences of COVID-19 each significantly independently predicted greater post-traumatic growth. Working in a clinical role and in mental healthcare or community physical healthcare predicted lower post-traumatic growth. Our research supports the value of taking an organisational growth-focused approach to occupational health during times of adversity, by supporting staff to embrace opportunities for personal growth. Valuing staff's cultural and religious identity and encouraging self-reflective activities, such as mindfulness and meditation, may help to promote post-traumatic growth.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

T1  - Parents experiences of pregnancy following perinatal loss: An integrative review
A1  - Donegan G.
A1  - Noonan M.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy following perinatal loss has a profound effect on parents and may contribute to intense psychological distress including grief, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. The subsequent pregnancy may also be perceived as more stressful due to the fear of recurrent loss. Midwives and other health care professionals need to be sensitive and empathetic to the needs of these parents when providing care in a pregnancy subsequent to a loss. METHODOLOGY: The aim of this integrated literature review was to explore parents' experiences of pregnancy following a previous perinatal loss using a systematic approach. This is presented in a five-stage process that includes problem identification, literature search, data extraction and evaluation, data analysis and presentation of results. A systematic search of seven electronic databases was conducted (Jan 2009 -Jan 2023) to identify relevant primary research which addressed parents' experiences of pregnancy following a previous perinatal loss. Seven papers met the eligibility criteria and were assessed for quality using Crowe's Critical Appraisal Tool (CCAT). Thematic analysis identified two themes. FINDINGS: The key themes identified from the literature were; the psychosocial needs and challenges faced by previously bereaved parents in subsequent pregnancies; and the need for specialist care and support in a subsequent pregnancy. Psychological needs and challenges included continued grief, depression, anxiety, and disparities in the grief process between men and women. The importance of specialist care with an increased level of support from competent, confident and compassionate health care providers was highlighted. CONCLUSION(S): The experience of pregnancy following a perinatal loss can be a complex emotional experience for parents. The review identifies the need for post pregnancy loss debriefing and counselling and care pathways specific to caring for women and their partners in a pregnancy subsequent to a perinatal loss. Care in pregnancy subsequent to loss should be provided by empathetic, competent health care providers and include additional antenatal clinic appointments, pregnancy monitoring and psychological support in order to meet the needs of these expectant parents.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).
