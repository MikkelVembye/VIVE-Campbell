\arguments{

\value{
Returns a numerical value for the cluster-design adjustment factor, \eqn{\gamma}.

\description{
This function calculates a small cluster-design adjustment factor which can be used
to adjusted effect sizes (independently of how clustering is handled) and the sampling variances from cluster-design studies
that adequately handles clustering. This factor can be found in second term of Equation (5)
from from Hedges & Citkowicz (2015, p. 1298). The factor is denoted as \eqn{\gamma}{\gamma} in WWC (2021).
The same notion is used here and gave name to the function.
}
\details{
When calculating effect sizes from cluster-designed studies, it recommended
(Hedges, 2007, 2011; Hedges & Citkowitz, 2015; WWC, 2021) to add an adjustment factor, \eqn{\gamma}{\gamma}
to \eqn{d}{d} whether or not cluster is adequately handled in the studies. Even if clustering
is adequately handled, WWC also recommend to use \eqn{\gamma}{\gamma} as a small number of clusters correction
to the variance component. The adjustment factor \eqn{gamma} when there is clustering in one
treatment group only is given by

\deqn{\gamma  = 1 - \dfrac{(N^C+n-2)\rho}{N-2}}

where \eqn{N} is the total samples size, \eqn{N^C}{N-C} is the sample size of the group without clustering, \eqn{n}{n} is
the average cluster size, and \eqn{\rho}{\rho} is the (often imputed) intraclass correlation.

Then let the naive estimator of Hedges' \eqn{g}{g} be

\deqn{g_{naive} = J\times \left(\dfrac{\bar{Y}^T_{\bullet\bullet} - \bar{Y}^C_{\bullet}}{S_T} \right)}

where \eqn{J = 1 - 3/(4df-1)}, \eqn{\bar{Y}^T_{\bullet\bullet}} it the average treatment effect for the
treatment group containing clustering, \eqn{\bar{Y}^C_{\bullet}} is the average treatment effect
for the group without clustering, and \eqn{S_T} is the standard deviation ignoring clustering. To account for the
fact that \eqn{S_T} systematically underestimates the true standard deviation, \eqn{\sigma_T}, making \eqn{g} larger than the true
values of \eqn{g}, i.e., \eqn{\delta}, the cluster-adjusted effect size can be obtained from

\deqn{g_T = g_{naive}\sqrt{\gamma}}

if a study properly adjusted for clustering, the sampling variance of \eqn{g_T},
(when based on posttest measures only) is given by

\deqn{v_{g_T} = \left(\dfrac{1}{N^T} + \dfrac{1}{N^C}\right) \gamma + \dfrac{g^2_T}{2h} }

where \eqn{N^T} is the sample size of the treatment group containing clustering and \eqn{h} is
given by

\deqn{ h = \dfrac{[(N-2)(1-\rho) + (N^T-n)\rho]^2}
{(N-2)(1-\rho)^2 + (N^T-n)n\rho^2 + 2(N^T-n)(1-\rho)\rho}}

where \eqn{N}{N} is the total sample size. \cr\cr

The reason why we do not multiply \eqn{J^2} to \eqn{v_{g_T}}, as otherwise suggested by Borenstein et al. (2009, p. 27)
and Hedges & Citkowitz (2015, p. 1299), is that Hedges et al. (2023, p. 12) showed in a simulation that multiplying \eqn{J^2} to
\eqn{v_{g_T}} underestimates the true variance.

\note{
Read Taylor et al. (2020) to understand why we use the \eqn{g_T}{g-T} notation.
Find suggestions for how and which ICC values to impute when these are unknown (Hedges & Hedberg, 2007, 2013).
