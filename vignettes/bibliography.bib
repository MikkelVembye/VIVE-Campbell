abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The relative effectiveness of two types of group therapy-the disease-and-recovery model and the cognitive-behavioral model-was examined in a public inpatient and outpatient setting with consumers who had a dual diagnosis of a personality disorder and a substance use disorder. Outcomes in four areas of problem severity were measured: alcohol use, drug use, social and family relations, and psychological functioning. METHODS: Using a quasiexperimental group design, 19 subjects in an inpatient mental health facility and 19 in a public outpatient facility were randomly assigned to the two experimental groups. The groups met three times a week for 12 weeks, and specific group leadership protocols were used. A third group at each setting received usual group treatment. Diagnoses of all subjects were verified using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. The Addiction Severity Index measured changes in problem severity. RESULTS: In the inpatient setting, subjects in both experimental groups had significantly improved social and family relations compared with the usual-treatment group; no posttest changes in the other three areas were noted. In the outpatient setting, cognitive-behavioral group therapy was significantly more effective than the other two group approaches in reducing alcohol use, improving social and family relations, and enhancing psychological functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the severity of mental health consumers' substance abuse problems can be substantially decreased in several areas in an outpatient public setting. In an inpatient setting, the use of either group therapy model was more effective in reducing problem severity than using no specific model.},

@article{Hedges2007a,
abstract = {Multisite research designs involving cluster randomization are becoming increasingly important in educational and behavioral research. Researchers would like to compute effect size indexes based on the standardized mean difference to compare the results of cluster-randomized studies (and corresponding quasi-experiments) with other studies and to combine information across studies in meta-analyses. This article addresses the problem of defining effect sizes in multilevel designs and computing estimates of those effect sizes and their standard errors from information that is likely to be reported in journal articles. Three effect sizes are defined corresponding to different standardizations. Estimators of each effect size index are also presented along with their sampling distributions (including standard errors).},

abstract = {Background: Cluster-randomized experiments that assign intact groups such as schools or school districts to treatment conditions are increasingly common in educational research. Such experiments are inherently multilevel designs whose sensitivity (statistical power and precision of estimates) depends on the variance decomposition across levels. This variance decomposition is usually summarized by the intraclass correlation (ICC) structure and, if covariates are used, the effectiveness of the covariates in explaining variation at each level of the design. Objectives: This article provides a compilation of school- and district-level ICC values of academic achievement and related covariate effectiveness based on state longitudinal data systems. These values are designed to be used for planning group-randomized experiments in education. The use of these values to compute statistical power and plan two- and three-level group-randomized experiments is illustrated. Research Design:...},

@article{Hedges2023_es_ancova,
abstract = {Abstract It is common practice in both randomized and quasi-experiments to adjust for baseline characteristics when estimating the average effect of an intervention. The inclusion of a pre-test, for example, can reduce both the standard error of this estimate and?in non-randomized designs?its bias. At the same time, it is also standard to report the effect of an intervention in standardized effect size units, thereby making it comparable to other interventions and studies. Curiously, the estimation of this effect size, including covariate adjustment, has received little attention. In this article, we provide a framework for defining effect sizes in designs with a pre-test (e.g., difference-in-differences and analysis of covariance) and propose estimators of those effect sizes. The estimators and approximations to their sampling distributions are evaluated using a simulation study and then demonstrated using an example from published data.},

@article{Hedges2015_onetreatcluster,
abstract = {Some experimental designs involve clustering within only one treatment group. Such designs may involve group tutoring, therapy administered by multiple therapists, or interventions administered by clinics for the treatment group, whereas the control group receives no treatment. In such cases, the data analysis often proceeds as if there were no clustering within the treatment group. A consequence is that the actual significance level of the treatment effects is larger (i.e., actual p values are larger) than nominal. Additionally, biases will be introduced in estimates of the effect sizes and their variances, leading to inflated effects and underestimated variances when clustering in the treatment group is not taken into account. These consequences of clustering can seriously compromise the interpretation of study results. This article shows how information on the intraclass correlation can be used to obtain a correction for biases in the effect sizes and their variances, and also to obtain an adjustment to the significance test for the effects of clustering.},
